gme_meltdown,30/12/2021 10:49:39 AM,hqj6tgv,"Not personal to me either, just another investment where I see potential.

Yes the temporary closures of shops did impact revenue 2020 but the 3000 stores (36% of all) permanently closed during few years is the main reason for declined revenue. The lifecycle of new consoles is just starting which will bring revenue for gamestop for years to come.

&amp;#x200B;

I have mentioned already multiple times that the losses were up and that:

&gt;With over 200+ senior hires *(ups, seems to be already 350 now)* from other tech companies, opening multiple fulfillment centers and corporate offices and the efforts to make transformation from brick and mortal to tech -company is not cheap and CEO told in Q3 report that ""the company wants to win market share and drive more sales ‚Äî with the belief that long-term gains and large profits will follow. Focus on the long term means we will continuously prioritize growth and market leadership over short-term margins"" which is pretty reasonable for me.

And I do root for using the money they have to become greater business and to expand into new markets. If the company wants to grow it has to spend money like every startup does. Gamestop is going to reborn from ashes as I see it and it is not the same brick-and-mortar business in which context you are trying to tie the company. Some is rooting for 20B - 100B ""startup"" companies with no or just minor sales + massive losses and you see debt free Gamestop with 1,5B cash and 6,5B sales and attempting to make shift away from brick and mortal to tech company as a biggest bubble. At same time the e-commerce is growing hundreds of percents each quarter. And as you said the brick and mortal still is reasonable business and there is always audience for that too.

It's everyones own decision do we trust the management Gamestop can turn itself to tech -company.

&gt;""We believe our emphasis on the long-term is positioning us to build what will ultimately become a much larger business relative to where we are in 2021,"" CEO Matt Furlong

The result we will see in coming next years will they succeed or not.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Though I will note that most of the ""profit"" Gamestop earned in Q4 2020 was actually covid-related tax breaks from things like the CARES Act. I do not know if that is still in place for this year, so while Gamestop should still make money this quarter, there is certainly a chance it makes a fair bit less than the same period last year.

If I remember right Q3 2020 results also included some positively affecting stuff. I would not be surprised if Q4 losses is bigger but do hope so that revenue grow 30% again. Most important thing for me is that the NFT marketplace is released and will help to keep the good momentum and revenue growth during next years and make the CEO's believe true 

&gt;""We believe our emphasis on the long-term is positioning us to build what will ultimately become a much larger business relative to where we are in 2021,"" CEO Matt Furlong

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Hell, I am sure some of those devs and pubs will love to sell them - as I already noted, a lot of people are weighting the risk of alienating their customers with the lure of convincing people to pay big money for worthless digital copies of art. And offering pictures that are disassociated from any P2W or P2E aspect will probably skate by relatively harmlessly.

 True, even though I might be too boomer to understand the value of those jpegs there clearly is demand for this NFT's. Just Adidas sold 22 million worth of NFT's in few hours a moment ago. If Gamestop will be the ruling marketplace for NFT's, oh boy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; But if you are thinking in terms of something like a used digital game resale service, you are in for a very rude awakening.

Nope, not just that. For example a one place to sell all in game related items, skins, clothes, guns, swords, cars, depends on game. If you currently buy some in game items you might not even be able to sell it later as all games does not have even have marketplaces.

Free to play games are already growing rapidly and game companies are looking the revenue more and more from other places.

Currently only a very niche people are interested in spending big bucks in games. If the game companies allows freely tradable in game items we would see much more money spend and earned in digital economies. When people get bored to specific game they would love to sell/trade the items for new game and this would certainly make more people interested and have less barriers to spend for in game items.

But I also liked the idea that since some designer brands hire their own fragrance people and don‚Äôt just outsource it, they‚Äôre creating something unique. 

Any dipshit with a bottle a few bottles of whatever purchased from Walmart can create a fragrance, but the snobs at Guerlain are probably testing the market, asking people their opinions, using their years of fragrance experience to create things based on what they know people have liked in the past or what they know people have never smelled before, taking into account pheromones, taking into account familiar scents and how to create them from scratch, etc. 

I can‚Äôt say if there‚Äôs any difference between designer or cheap brands. But I can say I only get compliments on the expensive fragrances. And it‚Äôs not even close.

**AITA for dressing my daughter in boy‚Äôs clothes even though it bothered MIL?**



I (f34) have a baby daughter who is 7m old. As a person I love to dress in basics. Black, white gray, navy brown. Jeans/slacks and tshirt. my dresses are always one color (often black) and just simple slip-ins, body-con, etc. I like to dress my daughter in the same ‚Äústyle‚Äù and therefore 90% of the time I find what I‚Äôm looking for in the boy‚Äôs departments. There‚Äôs no hidden agenda behind this. No ulterior motives. No malice and I‚Äôm not trying to make any statement. I just think I have the right to decide what I want my daughter to wear until she‚Äôs old enough to decide for herself. My husband loves my daughters clothes.

MIL does not like this. She wants to see my baby in fluffy pink and purple dresses. While I don‚Äôt think it wrong it‚Äôs just NOT my style. 

One day a couple of months ago she came by with a big bag of H&amp;M full of girls clothes in all the pink, purple and red shades. Dresses, skirts, coats leggings shiny shoes ages 6-12m. I didn‚Äôt know what to say so I thanked her. When husband came home I showed him he laughed and said I didn‚Äôt have to use them, but we decided on dressing our baby in the clothes MIL got us whenever we visited. It went all fine. 

Before Christmas I accidentally ran into MIL at a department store and I could see that MILs whole demeanor changed when she saw my baby in her usual jeans black sweatshirt and adidas. She didn‚Äôt say much and left without even a goodbye. She also commented on one of my sister‚Äôs insta stories why my daughter was wearing these horrible boy clothes.

On Christmas, we went over to MILs house (we celebrate with his and my family on alternate years). I had found the cutest black onesie with rudolf motif that I thought was perfect for the occasion. When we for there, MIL went berserk on me. She told me that I‚Äôm an elitist who‚Äôs abusing my daughter to make a point. That I‚Äôm confusing her by not letting her look like the rest of the girls her age and that I should wait for my daughter to be older and decide her identity herself instead of me trying to pushing my own agenda on her at this tender age. I was livid by this speech and told her she had no right to tell me how to dress or raise my daughter. That I thought the clothes we got from her were ugly and that I had donated them. I told her that she was sick and that SHE was the one with an agenda here and to stop pushing it on my daughter, or she will never see her again. By this stage everyone knew Christmas was ruined so we went home. 

I took out all the clothes MIL bought my daughter and put them in a bag to donate later. My husband said I was the AH. I told him she was the one who started the argument. He said nonetheless, I could‚Äôve ended it. But I don‚Äôt know how I could‚Äôve ended it. Was I the ah?

The idea is that you are sweating because you are warm, therefore dress for comfort when you are in the middle of your run, rather than when you just left home. Also you want enough airflow to allow the sweat to evaporate

For example, I keep wearing normal jogging shorts down to 4C, before switching to heavier shorts when it is close to freezing. I only wear tights once or twice a year. Note: I run every week of the year.

For my top, my base layer(s) are one or two long sleeve tech shirts. And I cover that with a water resistant medium weight running top (about the same heft as those Adidas training jackets). If it is at or below freezing, I may swap the inner tech shirt for an underarmour undershirt.

However, Peloton makes a tank top, slaps on their logo and then charges $52. Nope! I will not pay that much for their own line of workout wear.

Also, in the US at least, there were centuries when there was no difference between babies clothes for boys and girls. Does your MIL not know that?

I'm guessing she's thinking you're one of those, ""I'll let my child choose their gender later, for now they have no gender"" sort of people.

I (f34) have a baby daughter who is 7m old. As a person I love to dress in basics. Black, white gray, navy brown. Jeans/slacks and tshirt. my dresses are always one color (often black) and just simple slip-ins, body-con, etc. I like to dress my daughter in the same ‚Äústyle‚Äù and therefore 90% of the time I find what I‚Äôm looking for in the boy‚Äôs departments. There‚Äôs no hidden agenda behind this. No ulterior motives. No malice and I‚Äôm not trying to make any statement. I just think I have the right to decide what I want my daughter to wear until she‚Äôs old enough to decide for herself. My husband loves my daughters clothes.

MIL does not like this. She wants to see my baby in fluffy pink and purple dresses. While I don‚Äôt think it wrong it‚Äôs just NOT my style. 

One day a couple of months ago she came by with a big bag of H&amp;M full of girls clothes in all the pink, purple and red shades. Dresses, skirts, coats leggings shiny shoes ages 6-12m. I didn‚Äôt know what to say so I thanked her. When husband came home I showed him he laughed and said I didn‚Äôt have to use them, but we decided on dressing our baby in the clothes MIL got us whenever we visited. It went all fine. 

Before Christmas I accidentally ran into MIL at a department store and I could see that MILs whole demeanor changed when she saw my baby in her usual jeans black sweatshirt and adidas. She didn‚Äôt say much and left without even a goodbye. She also commented on one of my sister‚Äôs insta stories why my daughter was wearing these horrible boy clothes.

On Christmas, we went over to MILs house (we celebrate with his and my family on alternate years). I had found the cutest black onesie with rudolf motif that I thought was perfect for the occasion. When we for there, MIL went berserk on me. She told me that I‚Äôm an elitist who‚Äôs abusing my daughter to make a point. That I‚Äôm confusing her by not letting her look like the rest of the girls her age and that I should wait for my daughter to be older and decide her identity herself instead of me trying to pushing my own agenda on her at this tender age. I was livid by this speech and told her she had no right to tell me how to dress or raise my daughter. That I thought the clothes we got from her were ugly and that I had donated them. I told her that she was sick and that SHE was the one with an agenda here and to stop pushing it on my daughter, or she will never see her again. By this stage everyone knew Christmas was ruined so we went home. 

I took out all the clothes MIL bought my daughter and put them in a bag to donate later. My husband said I was the AH. I told him she was the one who started the argument. He said nonetheless, I could‚Äôve ended it. But I don‚Äôt know how I could‚Äôve ended it. Was I the ah?

NashvilleSC,30/12/2021 01:42:40 AM,hqhn4wd,"MLS roster rules are pretty confusing. But I‚Äôm short, you can have a roster of 30 players, 27 of which count against the salary cap, and 3 of which do not. These three are called ‚ÄúDesignated Players‚Äù and can be paid as much as the team is willing to spend. 

Of the other 27, no one can be paid less than the league minimum ~$63k or more than the league maximum ~$612k, with a total spend no greater than ~$4.9 million. 

The exception is General Allocation Money (GAM) which is can lower a players change against the salary cap. For instance, Walker Zimmerman makes something like $900k, ~$600k of which is charged against the cap, and $300k is from GAM. 

GAM can be traded, or acquire through ‚Äúselling‚Äù players to other leagues. It can also be used to pay transfer fees to ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù players from clubs in other leagues as well.

Imagine soccer if you will, one team gives away the entire stadiums worth of free tickets to their own fans so the entire stadium is making the environment hostile as fuck for the opponents. They also turn the lights up on one side of the stadium to hamper the goalies view, and they water the grass a lot to stop the other team passing cleanly. It's not fair but it is within the rules because the 22 men on the pitch are playing equally.


The other team, every time the referee looks away Christiano Ronaldo picks the ball up and runs with it in to the net.

&gt;New York, NY, December 14, 2021 ‚Ä¶ ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) joined with D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine, States United Democracy Center, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP and Dechert LLP today in filing a federal lawsuit to hold two violent groups accountable for the role they played in planning and carrying out the deadly January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

&gt;The lawsuit specifically claims the groups, and their leaders and members, caused extensive damage to the District of Columbia, and particularly to the law enforcement officers who risked their lives to defend the Capitol, those in it, the District, and our democracy.

&gt;The civil lawsuit is the first by a government entity against the January 6 insurrectionists. The lawsuit seeks to hold the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and their leaders and members accountable for their actions in planning and carrying out the January 6 attack and violating federal and District laws. It seeks to recover damages they caused to the District, particularly the physical, mental, and emotional injuries suffered by Metropolitan Police Department officers.

&gt;‚ÄúADL has been at the forefront of strategically monitoring, exposing, and countering extremist threats from across the ideological spectrum for decades,‚Äù said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director. ‚ÄúWe have deep expertise when it comes to the groups and individuals involved in the planning and execution of the January 6th attack and are honored now to be putting that expertise at the service of the District of Columbia and the brave officers who were injured or killed as a result of that day. Those who perpetrated the attack will not readily abandon their convictions. Domestic extremists, like the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and others, continue to present a serious, credible, and dangerous threat to our democracy and to us all. Accountability for January 6th is critically important to preventing another violent insurrection from happening in D.C. or in state capitols across the country.‚Äù

The partnership has caused some confusion- what exactly do the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers have to do with the ADL? The Proud Boys have bent over backwards uselessly signaling their group's diversity and opposition to bigotry. Even the ADL's [own dossier on the Oath Keepers](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/oath-keepers) admits that anti-Semitism is not a feature of the organization.

But this partnership was entirely predictable, as I [discerned last month](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/qk7w8u/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_november_01/hj7n7rm/) that the Charlottesville civil lawsuit predicated on the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 was not merely a one-off legal question, but was the beginning of a broader legal offensive of Jewish interests against right-wing organizations. The objective is to build precedent for a novel criminalization of speech that is justified by ""Civil Rights"" and therefore not so easily shielded by First Amendment protections, while making it more difficult for right-wing groups to raise money and organize. The lead attorneys and organizations involved in the Charlottesville trial admitted that this was the objective of the lawsuit in nearly these exact words, so this really shouldn't come as a surprise.

The [outcome of the Charlottesville Trial](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/12/why-charlottesville-matters/621096/) was mixed. The Jury did not reach a verdict on federal conspiracy charges. The Jury reached a verdict of ""guilty"" on state conspiracy charges, but only awarded $0 or $1 in damages to each plaintiff, and slapped the plaintiffs with millions in punitive damages. The message seemed to be ""the plaintiffs didn't prove you caused them injuries, but you have icky beliefs so we'll bankrupt you.""

&gt;What kind of reckoning, then, did the Charlottesville trial provide? As the verdicts rolled in, audible gasps greeted the announcement of the large damages awarded. Yet observers immediately spotted the wrinkles. The jury awarded $1 each to seven plaintiffs on the charge of violating Virginia conspiracy law, and $0 to two plaintiffs in terms of compensatory damages‚Äîfor actual harms suffered‚Äîbut then several million more for punitive damages, intended to punish outrageous conduct and deter other offenders. Yet because of a 2003 Supreme Court ruling that requires a narrow ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, the discrepancy may very well lead to a drastic reduction in the awards.

Still, the ADL seems to regard that as a good-enough signal to advance to a bigger stage. The civil lawsuit against the Proud Boys and Oathkeepers is based on the same legal theory:

&gt;With ADL serving as outside co-counsel, OAG filed the suit under federal and local laws, including the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, a Reconstruction-era federal law designed to provide a remedy against violent conspiracies that target our democracy like the attack that unfolded on January 6. 

It is probably more accurate to call OAG the outside co-counsel to the ADL, as this lawsuit is a clear continuation of the legal strategy hatched by Jewish interest groups in the Charlottesville trial. The ""civil"" aspect is operative here. After all, if the Oathkeepers actually engaged in conspiracy to attack the Democracy of the US, why wouldn't there be criminal charges for such a conspiracy? Two reasons: First Amendment protections, and criminal charges require *proof beyond a reasonable doubt* whereas a civil lawsuit only requires a preponderance of evidence.

The lower burden of proof for civil lawsuits make things like internet memes and ""hate speech"" have more utility in reaching that lower threshold of proof for a jury. It appeared to work in the Charlottesville trial, so this time the ADL itself is leading the charge on a bigger stage. 

Earlier this week, [USA Today](https://web.archive.org/web/20211226125717/https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/12/26/propaganda-white-supremacy-deradicalization/6503198001/?gnt-cfr=1) ran an article explaining how these lawsuits are only one part of a broader strategy against rigth-wing groups:

&gt;After years of frustration and alarm, several experts agreed they could be on the cusp of establishing ways to deter people from extremism and pull individuals out of hate groups.

&gt;The new approaches come as President Joe Biden has prioritized tackling homegrown extremism after years of denial under former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, far-right extremists have been cowed by criminal prosecutions stemming from the insurrection, as well as pioneering civil lawsuits that hit them where it hurts: their bank accounts.

&gt;‚ÄúThere's all kinds of tools at our disposal that we can use to fight this stuff, and there's a political will to do so right now,"" he said. ""So, as long as people can maintain a clear vision and momentum against it, I‚Äôm hopeful of what we can accomplish in the next year.‚Äù

&gt;...

&gt;**Moonshot: Going where government can‚Äôt**

&gt;The U.S. government has always faced a dilemma in tackling domestic extremism: It isn‚Äôt supposed to monitor people based on their ideology, nor should it track movements simply because their views are offensive to most people.

&gt;Law enforcement agencies are not allowed to target extremist groups unless they have broken the law or are about to.

&gt;But there‚Äôs nothing to stop private companies, organizations or individuals from monitoring hateful and extremist content. Organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center have teams of researchers to monitor and expose hate groups and individual extremists...

&gt;Moonshot, a tech startup founded in 2015, has pioneered an effort to ‚Äúredirect‚Äù individuals who search for extremist content online, by presenting them with alternatives meant to slow or stop them from developing extremist ideologies.

&gt;To do this, Moonshot employs the same targeted marketing that sells products. 

&gt;**Working with the Anti-Defamation League, Moonshot compiled keywords and phrases associated with extremism. The company bought advertising on Google and other platforms that deliver targeted ads to people who search for particular terms. 

&gt;If, for example, someone Googles ""great replacement theory,‚Äù Moonshot‚Äôs advertising would provide that person with videos, news stories or academic papers about how the racist theory has long been discredited. 

&gt;‚ÄúWe're just using the same commercial advertising tools that are available to any big brand ‚Äì to Coca-Cola, to Adidas, any big brand ‚Äì that's trying to reach their customers,‚Äù said Vidhya Ramalingam, Moonshot‚Äôs founder and CEO. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that for us, the customer base, so to say, is people who are at risk.‚Äù**

&gt;The company also has been working with Facebook to evaluate the effectiveness of the social media giant's ""Search Redirect"" effort, which is a similar initiative on the platform. When users search for hateful content on Facebook, the platform redirects them to alternative content that counters extremist narratives.

Soon added to the ADL's role as the [""primary ideological overseer of America‚Äôs Internet""](https://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-the-adl-in-american-society/) will be the [ADL's policing of the financial services industry](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/orsvle/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_26_2021/h6q3dm1/). The ADL has embedded itself in American political, economic, and cultural life to a degree that is hard to understate, and all indications are that this level of manipulation and control are *accelerating*.",1,Reddit,adidas

MANA was my first investment back in February and when I first read about the project I imagined household names, companies and celebrities purchasing land and using it to market their brand and host events. 

I also imagined it getting a slice of Hollywood in the sense that you could go watch a blockbuster at a virtual AMC with your friends from the comfort of your own home. Same with sporting and music events. 

I envisioned in time you could stick a VR headset on and go buy a pair of trainers from a virtual Nike or Adidas store and have them delivered to your home in the real world. 

I‚Äôve seen a few snippets of these visions in the game but DCL has surprised me so far by appearing to go down the NFT road. 

I still believe in the project massively but I‚Äôd like to see a lot more of the above happening before I actually download the game and I feel like this maybe the current reason as to why the daily users are so low.

Wreddit,29/12/2021 03:08:11 PM,hqf0cfx,"Charisma should really be called kavorka. It would clear up as much of the confusion around the term as possible.

Kavorka is an animal magnetism. It's not based on anything tangible. It just exists, and you know it when you see it.

It has absolutely nothing to do with cutting a promo. There are charismatic people who can't string two words together, and there are people who could go on for an hour without once being charismatic. If you've watched a handful of TED Talks you have a perfect example for this. If the person has that kavorka you're sucked in, and those 60 minutes go by in 5. If the person doesn't, you're turning it off after 5 minutes that felt like 60.

And lastly, people need to stop conflating having charisma with being cool. Bobby Heenan made a career out of making an ass of himself... yet he's one of the 10 most charismatic people in wrestling history. And then you have guys who are just so charismatic that whatever they're doing seems cool. Trust me, even in the 90s skintight jean shorts were not cool... but was anyone saying Austin looked silly in them? No. Why? Because his kavorka blinded us. Was there anything cool about The Rock wearing a knockoff Adidas sweatsuit? Were the ridiculous sideburns cool? Were the goofy looking Versace shirts cool? No, but at the time wrestling fans thought Rock was literally the coolest guy who ever lived. Why? Kavorka.",1,Reddit,adidas

FifaCareers,29/12/2021 09:12:23 AM,hqe36q1,"‚Ä¢ Player First and Last Name + Kit Name, or initials only (I‚Äôll choose the name based on player nationality and ascendancy).

‚Ä¢ Kit Number - Subject to availability. First come, first served. There will be no restrictions (if you are a GK or Defender, and wants a specific number, like #7 or #10, you will be served if no one has chosen your number before. Keep in mind I‚Äôm trying to make a realistic Career Mode, and I‚Äôm gonna track down the whole progress so choose fair numbers for the position you choose.)

‚Ä¢ Country of Origin + Ascendancy (choose a main country to stick the player to a specific country or national team, and if you desire to make him look more authentic, you can add a ascendancy for the player, which will help in the process of choosing the player‚Äôs name and creating a background for him if you don‚Äôt give me one - e.g.: Paul Pogba - French player with Guinean ascendancy: despite being born and raised in France, Pogba has Guinean roots, with his two brothers being born in Guinea and playing for the Guinea NT; Riyad Mahrez - French- born Algerian player: born in France, Mahrez opted to play for Algeria NT due to ascendancy).

‚Ä¢ Position: up to two positions, to refine player‚Äôs playing style. GK will be the only exception, because you cannot change the GK‚Äôs position in Career Mode.

‚Ä¢ Height and Weight: I suggest if you could list in cm/kg so I could get more accurate data, I‚Äôd appreciate it.

‚Ä¢ Preferred Foot: Left or Right, not a big deal. All players will be given 4* Weak Foot as default.

‚Ä¢ Strong points: Do you want your player to be a physically gifted type of player, a technician, or a pace merchant? Point out up to two game specialities to make your player to have better attributes in desired aspects of its game. There are six attributes involved: Pace, Shooting, Passing, Dribbling, Defending and Physical. Leaving in blank will be recognized as a balanced type of player, that will be really complete in every single aspect of the game.

‚Ä¢ Other aesthetic player settings - player‚Äôs skin tone, type of hair, facial hair, eye color, preferred boot sponsor (Nike, adidas, Puma, etc.), goal celebration. If no setting is defined by the user, I‚Äôll try to make an accurate representation of what the player could and would look like based on nationality, player ascendancy and origins. Example: a  Brazilian player could be a player with a somewhat light brown skin, with dark curly hair and brown eyes (just like me, a Brazilian), but depending on their origins they could be different. Example: Brazilian player with Japanese origins. It would have a more Asiatic look to reflect their ancestors. (IMPORTANT NOTE: NO RACISM INTENDED.

They‚Äôre pretty pricey and they‚Äôre only made for the players, and so not all sizes are available. I think the only way you can purchase them is through Meigreyauctions.com or when teams sell game worn jerseys on their sites. So you can basically say that the retail adidas ‚Äúauthentics‚Äù are really replicas. All that being said, I do get what you‚Äôre saying and agree about reebok authentic and replicas same with CCM.

If you‚Äôre precious about your gear, just know that boxing boots wear out FAST. It‚Äôs the thin soles - they help with quick movement, but they‚Äôre not durable. Some good cross training shoes can be just as useful.

AdidasSPZL,28/12/2021 11:42:14 PM,hqcc4kn,"Is there an official list of the SPZL shoes that have been released?

  


It's hard to find what was in each season. Would like to start a proper collection, but need to understand the history of releases.

  


Also, is SPZL primarily a UK release? I know Adidas has the City Series, but my understanding is it's seperate to the SPZL music/football/terrace lifestyle. I'm wondering if SPZL would be interested in openning the scope of the project to other countries?

  


I'm based in Spain and would like to look at ways to integrate the same music/football/culture history and apply it Spain. The 1980's saw the rise of Movimiento De Madrid y Vigo, Bilbao Music Festivals, 80's Nightclubs in Barcelona, 80's Bacalao Rave scene in Valencia, Northern European music influences in 1970-80's Andalucia underground culture.

  


There is a load of history around the 1970-80s music culture from different Spanish cities, in the same way Manchester at Northern England was the birthplace of underground music and house/rave culture.

  


Would love to adopt some of the terrace vibe from Spzl and see if it can be transposed onto Spanish underground history/culture. Given that football is integral to Spanish lifestyle it would be a cool way to get Spanish people more interested in the Spezial releases. I'm connected with some LaLiga players and they'd be up for bring music culture closer to football fans.

startups,28/12/2021 10:18:57 PM,hqc0dxm,"Here's a take from someone who has been working on it for the best part of the last 4 years on why, although I do think it's at peak hype at the moment, it will ultimately succeed:

1. It has a political/ philosophical implications, which retains talent. 
   1. I've seen this first hand: really freaking smart developers prefer to work on blockchain for 2 main reasons. 1. It's a beautiful mathematical exercise: zero knowledge rollups, Byzantine Fault tolerance algorithms, non-proof validations. These are things that, from a computational point of view, are beautiful complex problems to solve, and these type of people love these type of stuff. 2. The majority of devs would either work on this or trading algorithms for hedge funds. The point is, devs are usually anti-establishment, anti-status-quo and left leaning. At same remuneration and same complexity/ excitement for the problem, they'd rather work against the ""system"" or at least put it for good purpose.
2. There's a LOT of capital: most blockchain foundations by now have more capital than they would know what to do with. If they want to stir development somewhere, they have leverage to throw capital at it and outsource talent to work on it. I've seen it first hand too (won a couple of grants). There's enough money to push for this for the next decade. .
3. Too much web 2.0 involvement: by now Nike, Visa, Mastercard, Adidas, Gamestop, Unity, Facebook, Universal Music, Sony and tonnes more ""classical"" companies have made commitments and placed a bet on this being the new horizon. There's no coming back really. If it crashes, it has a much bigger repercussion than you think.

In conclusion, yes, it'll be a bumpy road, a LOT of people will get burned, but it's medium risk high reward situation. The ones that win will become the next trillion dollar company in 20 years. It's up to you whether you're willing to risk everything for that possibility. It excites me, but I do understand people that are not willing to do that jump.",1,Reddit,adidas

mauerstrassenwetten,28/12/2021 09:41:00 PM,hqbuvhw,"Also, erst einmal: All diese Dinge die ich vorgebracht habe, habe ich schon vertreten bevor ich GME gefunden habe - und viele andere auch. Ich verfolge und best√§rke die Themen bzgl Blockchain, Dezentralisierung, und Demokratisierung, schon seit ein paar Jahren, und Crypto Gaming auch l√§nger als GME. Ich bin eigtl erst durch \[EDIT, automod\]schlingel crypto zu GME gekommen (bin in schlingel crypto schon bissl mehr als ein Jahr investiert, und ich bin auch nebenberuflich Smart Contract Developer). Das mal als ""Disclaimer"" zu deinem ""Apes"" Ding. Ist halt kein Argument, nur ein sinnloses Ad Hominem ohne Gehalt.

  
Dann: Hab zu einigen Dingen die du erw√§hnst schon was geschrieben, einfach den Rest der Commentchain lesen, ja?

  
**Nun zu einem Detail: Incentives.**

  
Da g√§be ich dir Recht, es gibt nicht viele Incentives zur zeit, und auch darauf habe ich keine perfekte Antwort.

  
Ausser, naja, das im Moment einige Crypto Games entwickelt werden, bzw. schon entwicklet wurden, die sch√∂n fette Investments und Partnerschaften haben, teils VCs und DAOs (die beide Haufen an Kohl und Network mitnehmen) investiert sind, und das THema verfolgen und unterst√ºtzen.

  
Ich bin mir nicht sicher welche Incentives jetzt da sind - die Sache ist ahlt, die Konkurenz schl√§ft nicht. Es reicht nur ein Publisher, ein Studio, welches NFTs gscheit macht. Ohne Schei√ü, vor einem Jahr haben wir uns gedacht das es sicher noch drei, vier Jahre (also n Cycle) braucht bevor NFTs im Mainstream ankommen - und aufeinmal gibts Facebook das auf Metaverse macht, Ubisoft macht NFTs (lol), Adidas hat ne Coop mit Pixelvault und BAYC (beides riesige Namen in der Metaverse/web3/p2e industry). Das h√§tte sich keiner von uns im Traum ausgemalt.

  
Ich w√ºrde gerne ein l√§ngere Antwort geben, aber ich hab nicht das Gef√ºhl, dass es sich lohnt das hier mit euch zu diskutieren (siehe meine andere comment chain).

  
Aber, umrissen, metaverse, ob mit oder ohne Meta, gibt es nur mit web3. Crypto und NFTs (und damit web3) sind im mainstream diskurs. Das Thema Ownership ist ganz gro√ü in web3, und wird es auch bleiben.

  
Und ich verstehe vollkommen, wenn das grad nicht genug Antwort ist, aber, wie gesagt, ich hab nicht wirklich Lust Energie reinzustecken, nur um dann bad faith argumente zur√ºck zu bekommen, und mit nem moving goalpost zu diskutieren.  
Auf all deine Fragen gibt es Antworten, die man mit bissl Eigenrecherche machen kann.

  
**Hier bissl Meinung, braucht weniger Energie meinerseits, hilft aber auch vll:**

  
Und wenn du NFTs, web3, und crypto nur wegen GME schlecht findest, dann tut es mir wirklich Leid f√ºr dich. Diese Themen waren schon vor GameStop und Cohen da - und sie werden auch weiter nach Gamestop da sein, und sich auch weiter unabh√§ngig von GME entwickeln.

  
NFTs sind weit mehr als nur Bilder, oder Game Items.

  
Ich pers√∂nlich trau mich wetten (und das tue ich, nur die Dinge in die ich investiert bin), das NFT Lizenzen f√ºr Spiele, zu einer h√∂heren Marge f√ºhren w√ºrden.

  
Im Moment lade ich\* Spiele runter, wenn ich nicht sicher bin ob sie mir gefallen - selten kauf ich sie dannach wirklich\*, nur wenn sie mir WIRKLICH gefallen kauf ich sie.

  
Wenn ich jetzt ein Spiel kaufen k√∂nnte, es spielen, und dann mir denke, meh, ich verkaufs wieder - dann w√ºrde ich mehr Spiele kaufen.  
Einen Second Hand Markt f√ºr Games gibt es zZ nur bei physischen Spielen - und da kann der Publisher nicht mitnaschen.

  
Bei NFT Lizenzen, l√§sst sich superleicht eine prozentuale Abgabe f√ºr jeden Resell einprogrammieren.

Crash Bandicoot runterladen\*, taugt mir vielleicht, ich spiele es, ur geil, und vielleicht kauf ichs irgendwann wenn ich dran denke\* oder im Sale. Sollte klar sein, dass in diesem Case weniger Geld steckt.

  
Wir haben ein √§hnliches Verhalten bei Spotify und Netflix gesehen - Leute haben kein Problem zu zahlen, sie haben nur kein Bock darauf verarscht zu werden. 10-20‚Ç¨ Flat f√ºr Filme? Geil, nehm ich.

mauerstrassenwetten,28/12/2021 09:37:50 PM,hqbueyr,"Also, erst einmal: All diese Dinge die ich vorgebracht habe, habe ich schon vertreten bevor ich GME gefunden habe - und viele andere auch. Ich verfolge und best√§rke die Themen bzgl Blockchain, Dezentralisierung, und Demokratisierung, schon seit ein paar Jahren, und Crypto Gaming auch l√§nger als GME. Ich bine igtl erst durch Loopring zu GME gekommen (bin in Loopring schon bissl mehr als ein Jahr investiert, und ich bin auch nebenberuflich Smart Contract Developer). Das mal als ""Disclaimer"" zu deinem ""Apes"" Ding. Ist halt kein Argument, nur ein sinnloses Ad Hominem ohne Gehalt. 

Dann: Hab zu einigen Dingen die du erw√§hnst schon was geschrieben, einfach den Rest der Commentchain lesen, ja?

Nun zu einem Detail: Incentives.

Da g√§be ich dir Recht, es gibt nicht viele Incentives zur zeit, und auch darauf habe ich keine perfekte Antwort. 

Ausser, naja, das im Moment einige Crypto Games entwickelt werden, bzw. schon entwicklet wurden, die sch√∂n fette Investments und Partnerschaften haben, teils VCs und DAOs (die beide Haufen an Kohl und Network mitnehmen) investiert sind, und das THema verfolgen und unterst√ºtzen.

Ich bin mir nicht sicher welche Incentives jetzt da sind - die Sache ist ahlt, die Konkurenz schl√§ft nicht. Es reicht nur ein Publisher, ein Studio, welches NFTs gscheit macht. Ohne Schei√ü, vor einem Jahr haben wir uns gedacht das es sicher noch drei, vier Jahre (also n Cycle) braucht bevor NFTs im Mainstream ankommen - und aufeinmal gibts Facebook das auf Metaverse macht, Ubisoft macht NFTs (lol), Adidas hat ne Coop mit Pixelvault und BAYC (beides riesige Namen in der Metaverse/web3/p2e industry). Das h√§tte sich keiner von uns im Traum ausgemalt.

Ich w√ºrde gerne ein l√§ngere Antwort geben, aber ich hab nicht das Gef√ºhl, dass es sich lohnt das hier mit euch zu diskutieren (siehe meine andere comment chain). 

Aber, umrissen, metaverse, ob mit oder ohne Meta, gibt es nur mit web3. Crypto und NFTs (und damit web3) sind im mainstream diskurs. Das Thema Ownership ist ganz gro√ü in web3, und wird es auch bleiben. 

Und ich verstehe vollkommen, wenn das grad nicht genug Antwort ist, aber, wie gesagt, ich hab nicht wirklich Lust Energie reinzustecken, nur um dann bad faith argumente zur√ºck zu bekommen, und mit nem moving goalpost zu diskutieren.

Auf all deine Fragen gibt es Antworten, die man mit bissl Eigenrecherche machen kann.

*Hier bissl Meinung, braucht weniger Energie meinerseits, hilft aber auch vll:*

starterpacks,28/12/2021 06:13:32 PM,hqazx86,"It also completely explains the ""weird"" ending.

I used to think the perfect ending was in season five - he's married again to a brunette copy of his wife, he's gonna let her pursue her dreams instead of saddling her with kids like he did with Betty, and someone comes up to introduce a friend to him in a bar and asks ""are you alone?"" Because the series is very much about American loneliness.

But if you take that beat/ending, with season 1's ending, wirh the series finale, a very interesting picture emerges.

There's a book called ""anti-oedipis: capitalism and schizophrenia"" that would actually *go on to influence the entire business plan of buzzfeed.* The Marxist writers of the book explain that capitalism inherently makes you feel lonely. They're expanding on Marx's assertion of alienation that in capitalism you will feel lonely because you aren't the owner and maker of a good but a cog and machine; the writers go in to say ""no, capitalism has advanced so much that people will not just feel lonely, but without identity, ant the way to *build identity will be by buying things*. You're not a Whole Foods buyer, you're a Trader Joe's buyer. You're team adidas not team Nike. The owner of buzzfeed said this is why he built buzzfeed - people are so listless and lonely and without identity that taking ""which Disney character are you?""appeals to people in late stage capitalism. (Note, if you reader Marxists, ""late"" in late stage means ""current"" not ""final"".) And then they would take the info from these quizzes and sell them as consumer profilers to people like Don.

I mention all of this because *Don is the architect of this type of loneliness*. He fucking says ""people buy things to find out something about themselves."" His entire work is about assualting the American consciousness. ""Advertising"" In other languages is correctly called ""propaganda"" - because that's what it is. His goal is to sell you the image of carousal when the reality for many people is the same loneliness he feels. *And the reason the carousel pitch works is because people feel the same loneliness he feels.* His work is about turning the American populace not into people, *but into consumers*. And as consumers you will continuously buy things in the hope that it will make you feel human again. And that's why it ends on a coke ad that fucking preaches togetherness and community. Because this turning of people into not citizens but consumers makes you feel lonely, all you are is a thing that fucking buys, and thing you actually want more than anything is community, a feeling that you are no longer alone - and you will never fucking get it in late stage capitalism.

But you can buy a coke.",1,Reddit,adidas

He kissed my mother goodbye, and hugged my father. Papa had a strange mixture of fear, sadness, and resentment on his face. My brother left. For the last time. Ever.

'luxury' brands like coach ck Kate spade.

For entertainment, I've picked a Adidas Superstar CNY from February. I picked it to get all the Nike fans to reply and say something different.

  


Rules for the sleeper pick:

1. It cannot be an Jordan 1. Any Jordan 1 suggestions will be downloaded to oblivion.

2. You cannot suggest a Jordan 1 colorway.

3. You can't vote for a Jordan 1 collaboration.

4. If you bought Jordan 1s this year because of all the hype, please open your sneaker research to a broader set of options. In the old days, sneaker shopping was about showing your personality with what you wear. Now it feels like Jordan head office are taking the piss with all these colorways. If you love your speakers, and Jordan 1 was your ""gateway drug"" into sneaker hype, keep your love for Jordan, but next time look further for Specialist sneakers.

Nowadays dressmakers are rare, hard to find and expensive. As are many other similar jobs that were carried out in a similar fashion.

Similar to you, I grew up in the 80's and the dynamic and actual economic realities are not even remotely comparable.

That's not to discount the experience of anyone currently struggling with housing. It's a serious problem that needs a serious response. A return to state housebuilding would perhaps be a better response than the efforts at PPP the Govts have pursued over the last 30yrs.

It's not to compare the ""Soft"" kids of today, with the ""it was so hard back in my day"" tropes.

They are and were different times, and getting into mine was worse pissing contests doesn't help solve the problem.

But as an experiential point? 
My youngest brother was born in 2001, he grew up not knowing hunger, hand me downs or butter vouchers! 

I was already living abroad when he was born, I was working away and when he was 4 I took my family out on their 1st foreign holiday. I had 1 of my older brothers living with me when my Mam and the rest of the family arrived. We picked them up at the airport and seeing them was brilliant but, one thing that always sticks with me from that day?

AskMen,28/12/2021 05:48:44 AM,hq8uzdd,"There are more disabled people in the US than Lebbos my dude. 

Unless we want to count all immigrants, which I invite you to do, because one in three Hispanic kids are being brought up well below the poverty line. Could there be some kind of unique historic circumstances affecting the experience of south and Latin Americans in the United States? 

With that said, if shitloads disabled people are becoming homeless it indicates that those safety nets, which are features of the system, aren't working. [This](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/evidence-based-living/202009/what-we-know-about-homelessness-and-intellectual-disability) suggests that 30 - 40% of homeless in the US have a form of neurological condition, from autism to brain injury. [This](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/abs/homelessness-and-mental-illness/96004FD276BC2033797FDCE694D8D3DB), which I already linked you, shows 30 - 50% of homeless in the UK have a profound mental illness. So in both cases at least one in four people with disabilities end up on the street; does this square with the idea that it's just white teens pretending to have depression to get out of their shift at Micky Ds? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Obviously people who are genuinely severely disabled mentally or physically are not who we‚Äôre taking about

&amp;#x200B;

OK, fair. Back to the kid in the car situation. [This](https://www.nccp.org/publication/childhood-and-intergenerational-poverty/) shows that growing up in poverty ‚Äî that's ""I live in my dad's car"" poverty, not my parents and grandparents were working class poverty ‚Äî usually results in someone being incapable of escaping poverty. [This](https://www.ballardbrief.org/our-briefs/intergenerational-poverty-in-the-us-83scy) provides demographic breakdowns, causative analysis and even proposes some systemic solutions to intergenerational poverty. We are now seeing more people being born into homelessness or who become homeless early in childhood than ever before, a process that began in the 1930s and escalated radically during the 1970s. The idea that a nine year old just needs to hustle harder and that it's his fault he's sleeping in a shelter tonight is just ridiculously disconnected from reality. And to say he's not who we're talking about is blatantly disingenuous because, again, we can demonstrate that poverty is cyclical and often intergenerational for reasons beyond that individual's control. 

More importantly, it is a known thing in education that socioeconomic factors diminish your chances of academic success. Every teaching textbook you'll get your hands on covers this. [Here is one of countless studies](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4261.3Main+Features32011), this one based in Queensland, Australia, yet another Western country (I'm trying to demonstrate these problems are consistent throughout the world) that suggests this.

Interestingly**,** it also demonstrates that remoteness, that is living in a small country town vs. a city, is another indicator of reduced chance at success, which is also another major factor you've ignored: imagine getting a job or finding a way to afford a move from a small manufacturing town after the company offshores to China? Where will you hustle when the hustling is gone? 

Anyway, you never actually refuted any of this. You just said your grandparents went through some shit in a totally different economic situation and that you know some guys who did well. Cool. In so doing you also said they were able to reach the middle class. Also cool. That doesn't mean no one in the West is poor for reasons beyond their control and if you sincerely believe that the only people who are struggling are just lazy, then idk, man. I've linked several studies, you've said ""based on my experience."" These arguments are just built different.

Here's another consideration. If you're making six figures, wouldn't the people you're consistently exposed to generally be proximal to your social class? How much time do you spend handing out soup at the local kitchens, mate? Probably not a lot. This is what scientists call ""[confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)."" It's why ""I know a guy"" isn't evidence but standardised peer-reviewed studies are. It's like if I were to say all Lebanese people I know are [loud kids.](https://youtu.be/iw8soyvhnOI) This is actually true of my lived experience, because I went to a high school where all the Lebanese kids assimilated into a very Italian-Australian soccer and ADIDAS-focused youth culture, but because it's possible to be aware of things beyond your immediate lived experience by, like, *reading,* I'm aware that not all Lebanese people are 19 years old and angry about elevators.",1,Reddit,adidas

&gt;SPIEGEL: Can the testers win this race?

&gt;Heredia: Theoretically yes. If all federations and sponsors and managers and athletes and trainers were all in agreement, if they were to invest all the money that the sport generates and if every athlete were to be tested twice a week ‚Äì but only then. What‚Äôs happening now is laughable. It‚Äôs a token.

&gt;SPIEGEL: So the idea that sports are a fair competition within established rules actually died long ago?

&gt;Heredia: Yes, of course. Unless we were to go back to ancient times. Without television, without Adidas and Nike. It‚Äôs obvious: if you finish in 8th place at a big event, you get $5,000; if you finish first you get $100,000. Athletes think about this. Then they think that everyone else dopes anyway, and they are right. And you think athletes believe in morals and ideals? Peak performances without doping are a fairytale, my friend.

&gt;SPIEGEL: Is there doping at every level of athletics?

&gt;Heredia: Yes, the only difference is the quality of the doping. Athletes with little money use simple steroids and hope they don‚Äôt get tested. The stars earn 50,000 dollars a month, not including starting bonuses and shoe sponsorship contracts.

stlouisblues,28/12/2021 12:07:22 AM,hq7nxu2,It all depends on what you are looking for and what parts of the jersey you are willing to sacrifice quality. I could never own a fanatics jersey buy will not gatekeep them either. The quality of the front crest and leetering/numbering is just plain awful imo. Heat pressed logos look terrible. The glossy sheen is very noticeable compared to twill and embroidered crests. The fanatics are made more for fans while the Adidas and made in Canada are cut more for wearing with equipment. Some people may even prefer the fanatics due to the slimmer cut in the sleeves and pits. I like the retail Adidas the most as they cut the quality in the places that aren't necessary outside of the game. This can make wearing the made in Canada jerseys less comfy. The devil is in the details with the jersey differences. I hope this helps with your decision.

It sounds like you‚Äôd benefit from using a trail/road hybrid shoe, which should be more sturdy and grippy than a road shoe but not have a super aggressive outsole like some dedicated trail shoes.

Good options include: 


Hoka Challenger ATR 6

Salomon Ultra Glide 

The North Face Vectiv Enduris 

Adidas Terrex Two Parley

For years I've worn Adidas Moves for her and I'm pretty much done my bottle. I cannot find it easily and now, at 36, feel that I need to branch out and try something new. I work in Healthcare so I can't have anything too strong.

I love a fresh/clean scents, I like coconut/vanilla bit don't like anything too sweet. I dislike anything musky/roses.

I never fitted in to that picture, I only owned two grey sweatshirts and two blue jeans. Wore those for years.

But I got more and more anxious because I felt like I was sticking out due to me being so ""underdressed"" that i chose to make a change. I had no fucking clue about fashion and my first steps was to download the Nike and Adidas app because that's the only brands I knew at this time.

But with some time, social Media and second hand shops I actually managed to create a unique style that really fits me (or it least I'd like to think that). Even though it's weird and is getting me looks i never felt more confident in public.

But what is way more interesting is that during my style change, wich took several years, i created some sort of a new social identity. Because now you just have to look at me to know I'm the weirdo.

I never thought I'd like this way of dressing, but it has enabled me not being stuck at being the shy guy that tries his best to fit in but is failing every time at it.
 
I mean, I'm a pretty huge guy (6'6) and i will always stick out because of that. But by dressing weird and eccentric I keep most of the people away that i don't care about, and people that still approach me are, for the most part, interesting people at least.",1,Reddit,adidas

BackdoorGoRe2,27/12/2021 06:56:21 AM,hq4d16d,"Never mind, translation found 

Taken from a piece I wrote many years ago:

A group of rebel Chechens, led by Salautdin Temirbulatov crossed into the Republic of Dagestan, in an attempt to rout out the occupying Russian forces. Temirbulatov's group came across a village being defended by a sparse group of 13 Russian conscripts. Upon realizing they were greatly outnumbered, 7 of the soldiers fled, while the remaining 6 continued to fight. Once they had run out of ammunition, they surrendered themselves into a promised POW status.

The tape opens with the six soldiers laying on the ground, face down, the one furthest to the right is straddled by a Chechen soldier, who is sawing at the neck of the soldier, leaving his twitching, gurgling body to lay face down in a spreading pool of thickened blood.

The other five soldiers do their best to ignore their friend's plight, totally aware of similar gruesome fates that doubtless await them. Shortly thereafter the leftmost soldier is assaulted, stabbed in the chest and shoulders to subdue him before running his throat out as well.

The cold eye of the camera moves in for a fetishized closeup as his skin turns ashen from blood loss. The lack of oxygen slows his movements and reflexes, and we are left to watch the exposed trachea struggling to pull in air, a high-pitched whistling ushering forth from the gaping maw opened by the blade. The Chechen pauses to wipe the soldier's blood from his blade onto the hand of the dying man.

The remaining three lay motionless, wondering when their turn will come. The Chechens carry on as if nothing unusual is happening, even occasionally laughing to one another.

Number two is told to stand, while someone runs over to deepen the wound in six's throat, as he is not bleeding out sufficiently fast. He still struggles to raise himself from the ground, but the pain and weakness are beginning to overtake him and he fades in and out of consciousness as the blood continues to flow.

The second soldier is pulled off to the side, about 10 yards from his dying comrades and is kicked to the ground, a Chechen brandishing a large knife stands above him, making fervent attempts to slice at the side of the soldier's throat. The soldier cowers and blocks until covering his head with his hands and crying for his mother. The camera cuts away as the rebel strikes home with the blade.

The camera pans back to the lineup of soldiers, pausing to zoom once again on the wide opened throat of number one, who is slowly moving his hands towards his head, while lulling from side to side. We see the gathering rebels standing around the crowd of dying soldiers, some pointing and laughing, some carrying on about their business.

Now the camera pans back to the second soldier who has been separated from the group. A small puddle of blood has formed under him, but it is apparent that his injuries are not life threatening. A second rebel comes to finish the job and the soldier pulls himself up as the man moves to cut. They struggle briefly and then the Russian charges from the scene. We do not see his fate, but are led to believe that he was shot in the back during his escape.

The next is pulled and separated from the remaining soldiers, begging for his life. He points out where some weapons are hidden and attempts to appeal to his captors. I provide below a translation of the next part, provided by a user at the Ogrish Forums named Warlord47, the provider of the tape I am describing. His translation helps to describe the horror underpinning the events as they unfold:

Aleksey Lipatov screaming .. 3 on 1
Aleksey Lipatov ""Come on fellows ... I just want to live""

Aleksey Lipatov ""Leave me alone!""
Knife goes thru throat.
Aleksey Lipatov is kneeling while get butted in the head with an AK

Chechen with knife ""Ill do this by myself!""
Cutting Aleksey Lipatov
Stabbing in the neck ... over and over and over .... Aleksey Lipatov is no more.

The camera moves back to the group laying on the ground and zooms in for a closeup of the face of the next soldier as his head is pulled back and his throat slashed. He has a very low blood pressure, so we see the contortions of agony in his face as throws his body and rolls around, neck ripping wider with each passing moment, until he too lays motionless.

We never see the death of the sixth, but we do see his corpse.

The video ends with the soldiers' corpses being unceremoniously dumped into a shallow grave.",1,Reddit,adidas

Doc martins are TERRIBLE. unless you have previously broken them in do not where these to work you will hate your life. my coworker showed me her heels after work and they were literally BLEEDING. 

Converse, no padding, no support 

Vans, tiny bit more padding but still not great. 

Flats, no support, fall off when you‚Äôre walking fast, no padding, usually give you blisters on your heels 

Shoes that I do recommend are: 

Air forces, these are what I wear and my feet never hurt and they‚Äôre easy to just throw in the washer and get all the syrup off. OR, walmart had an equally comfy off brand version that is probably a better and cheaper idea.

TumblrInAction,27/12/2021 02:15:50 AM,hq3ilqy,"This entire gender ideology is a pure capitalist movement.

It started with gender discussions in US universities, that rely on donations of the rich, of middle class bored brats looking to be special. It spread onto tumbler, a US IT company founded by some dude from the upper west side that quite quickly had adds and campaigns by big companies like adidas.

Gender ideology has quite quickly been picked up by big companies looking to get money from social justice promotion. It's hard to find one that has not waved the trans flag at any point. Big social media sites ofcourse joined in.

Meanwhile big pharma is making bank of it and lobbying it all first world countries which is why laws are haphazardly made to accommodate the genderfolk at the detriment of other people.

Everything about anything gender is not about being yourself its about buying shit to conform to some sexist antiquated stereotypes.

Non binary? If you're a girl better get that short haired blue hair and a breast binder. Boy, go buy some grandma earrings.

Trans? Well step right up and buy your puberty blockers and hormones. Make sure to pick up some major surgeries to fix your tits and face.

Dont forget the wigs, hairdye and fake nails. Oh and FLAGS get your flags. Ofcourse don't forget the merch in most clothing stores in your pastel colours!

Merch is great so pride is not good enough! We now have pronoun day, trans day, trans week of visibility, trans awareness day, ace visibility day, non binary day, transgender day of rememberance, pan day, ...  Make sure you pick up all the flags !

It's the most funded and sponsored ideology in history of mankind that disguised itself as ""the new gay rights"" when it's anything but that.

No one is ""queering the notion of gender"" , no one is ""breaking through stereotypes"" infact its the complete opposite. This is not revolution its submission to capitalistic dogma.",1,Reddit,adidas

It's a tad heavy, but that's my only real complaint with it.  Oh and the price, though you can find Ultraboost 20s on sale for $100-130 if you shop various colorways.

For similar shoes, look for cushioned neutral training shoes with a 8-10mm offset (heel to toe drop).  Mizuno Wave Sky, Nike Vomero, Saucony Triumph are similar.

homefitness,27/12/2021 01:43:32 AM,hq3elcz,"Hey Chris. Give it a try man, you will definitely not be disappointed. You have my word ;)  
There are tons of ropes out there, some worked for me well, some didnt. I bought 3 in total and borrowed one from a friend. I share with you some links from German Amazon, but you should be able to find similar products in your region if you are not in europe:

In general i would suggest you thicker but stable ropes, as a beginner you get a feeling for the rope and it feels easier to master the skill. Later on you can start with thinner, lighter ropes (speed ropes etc.)

1- Amazon Basics Standard Rope ([Link](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07TCNBG5Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)): Somehow it wasn't stable enough for me, kept tripping. Still cheap, heavy and more stable than other ropes.  


2- A Speedrope with thin rope ([Link](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07N8C4N1M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)). This one wasnt stable enough, kept tangling into itself. High rating is not understandable for me :)  


3- A Speedrope with long handles ([Link](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07J51VB8L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)). This one is one of my favorite ropes. It feels really good, light, yet stable. No tripping issuess.  


4- Adidas Jumprope ([Link](https://www.blokker.nl/springtouw-adidas-luxe-set/1622164.html?dfw_tracker=10589-1622164&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAwqCOBhCdARIsAEPyW9li6wFFZOdoxX9-HGttdPNaNilyYef2A1IkJxUA-hSFTUJr7ASejWoaAtMaEALw_wcB)). This one i borrowed from a friend. But i found a link for you to see the product. This is the best one from all for a beginner to start with. It is mainly because of the thicker rope (White) it has. It is a steel wire cladded with a thick plastic sleeve. It keeps really stable, so you can just keep jumping without tripping for a long time.",1,Reddit,adidas

At first i started to get 3euros per product (=my own tax on them) and later, mostly on sneakers i put a 15euro tax which is pretty good income. 

I used this money to buy sneakers and clothing! So i had a replica site and real things site. I bought things from adidas for example at 50% off for 50‚Ç¨ and sold it for 75 a month later after the sale ended. This was a no-risk way to earn money and make contacts with other resellers or clothing after-sale guys and so on.

I personally think the 19's have the best balance of springiness and cushioning. I like my 20's for when I want an extra squishy cushioned step, but I default to the 19's for the support.

Zero drop means the heal and forefoot is the same level. Most every running shoe has a heel wedge of stacked foam and tapers off to the front.

 It really shifts your form. I already was focusing on forefoot striking apposed to heelstriking and i found the Altras to really promote ""natural"" running. Like how you would run barefoot. My toes have the room to splay out properly.

streetwear,26/12/2021 09:36:26 PM,hq2j0jd,"Ok i delfinitely got a few...  


Let me start with the BAPE Stuff. A Bathing Ape x Undefeated x ZX 5000 'Camo' is one of the first things tha comes to mind.Also the BAPE X Undefeated X adidas Superstar 80's is up there too. I am a person who wear a size 13 in shoes except for the Nike SB Lows and i have seen these prices and the avaliable sizes flip flop more than a college spring break party. Now that i am thinking about it oo might as well add the apperal too...

Some JBF Custom Joints would be SOO good. I would love to recreate the bape jordan 3's with a few changes but it's like 1200 to be made and that's if you do got all the materials. But honestly I hope to do something even better if i have the idea...   


Stuff from Supreme from 2011-13 is on that list too. For me it was the beginning times i learned about streetwear but if i do have to pick one piece from supreme it would be the APC x Supreme Jeans because that pair was the inspiration for the jeans shown in How To Make It In America. (I have a cast and crew hoodie from the show that is going to be a part of a fit so keep a look out...)

An Official Playboy Polo in White and black logo or vicer verser and it doesn't have to be supreme. I like it because it's a lowkey piece that i always thought was dope.  


Speaking of Polo, I would love to get one of the classic bear pieces as a hoodie or shirt. Nuff said.

A North Carolina man wanted for sex crimes against minors is now wanted in Texas in connection with an Amber Alert issued for three of his five children.

Jonathon Alexander Wright, 40, was traveling through Texas last week with his wife and children, when their car broke down in Medina County, WLOS reported. The family set off on foot, the Medina County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said, deciding to live off the land.

Wright‚Äôs wife and the family‚Äôs two older children were spotted walking to a store in Rio Medina, Sheriff Randy Brown said. A deputy spoke to them and the wife said that the family was on the run and that Wright has multiple warrants in Mooresville, North Carolina.

Wright was arrested on November 3 on three counts of second-degree sexual exploitation of a minor, related to child pornography charges, the Mooresville Tribune reported. He was released from the Iredell County Detention Center after posting a $100,000 bond.

A week later, the Mooresville Police Department said it had filed six counts of third degree sexual exploitation of a minor but were unable to locate him.

Wright‚Äôs wife, Christal Ann Wright, was also arrested during the initial service of a search warrant on November 3 and charged with possession of marijuana and resist, obstruct, and delay. She was released on a $2,500 bond.

Brown said that Christal Ann Wright and the two older children were safe and cooperating with law enforcement, WLOS said.

‚ÄúMy understanding, his kids think their dad hung the moon,‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúWell, he needs to step up and let them be in a safe place while he goes and fights his own battle.‚Äù

Texas authorities issued an Amber Alert Tuesday night for Jonathon Wright, 11; Lucas Wright, 9; and Ariana Wright, 8. Deputies said the three children and their father were last seen near Settlers Pass, a neighborhood in Rio Medina near Castroville.

Eleven-year-old Jonathon is described as 4 feet 8 inches tall and 80 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen in all green outerwear, a bright blue LL Bean undercoat, and gray Adidas shoes with red bottoms.

Lucas is described as 4 feet 5 inches and 70 pounds with brown hair and hazel eyes. He was also wearing all green outwear when last seen, with a purple LL Bean undercoat, and brown boots with a camo leaf on top.

Ariana is described as 4 feet 5 inches and 70 pounds with brown hair and hazel eyes. Also wearing all green outerwear, Ariana was last seen in an orange, blue, and white LL Bean undercoat and gray Adidas shoes with red bottoms.

The father is 40 years old, 5 feet 9 inches and 170 pounds with brown hair and eyes. He may be wearing a green jacket/hoodie.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre worried about catching him, but we want to get those kids,‚Äù Brown told KRIS. ‚ÄúThey need to be in a warm bed.‚Äù

KSAT reported Friday that the US Marshals Service has offered a $5,000 reward for information about the family. Anyone with information should contact the Medina County Dispatch Office at 830-741-6153.",1,Reddit,adidas

Meanwhile, things that were invented for, or by Nazi's, some of which im sure you still use:

Orange Fanta was invented for Nazi's, and Adidas &amp; Puma were founded by two nazi brothers. The Adi in adidas *Literally* stands for Adolf. Oh, and hitler also helped design the Volkswagen Beetle. There are many more as well. 

I don't like Nazi's. I make that abundantly clear by wearing a St. Pauli FC jacket lol. What I do like is science. And I'm not so far up my own ass to deny that without fascists performing human experiments during WWII, then we would know a lot less about medicine, psychology, and biology. I can still hate the Nazis with every fiber of my being, and still admit that. The term 'Asbergers syndrome' is going to stick around, because he was the person who first described it.

I had NEVER been so hyped about a transfer; KT's story, professionalism, drive, skillset, and the way he plays all made him such a wonderful addition. (I STILL cannot believe more teams were not as interested). I still need a home #3 kit, but Adidas keep releasing banger change shirts for us, lol... I just love the way this guy carries himself for the club AND how he plays. I have always felt partial towards players who have that special combination of intelligence (in movement, touches, passing, etc.), consistency, and impact, and our boy from Celtic really has everything. 


He seems really receptive to the coaching he is getting, and, if he stays healthy, there is NO reason he will not be an important part of a very special next 4 or 5 years for us.


We are so lucky to have him, and it seems he is happy to be a part of the Arsenal family. Really wonderful.

running,26/12/2021 12:43:34 AM,hpz1lqq,"It depends on the shoe, your weight and running stride, and personal sensitivity.

Some people wear through shoes really quickly or are really sensitive to harshening rides and thus need to replace them really frequently. Others have mechanics that aren't as hard on the shoes and/or aren't super sensitive to changes in ride characteristics, and can thus replace their shoes a lot less frequently. It also depends heavily on the shoe, as some shoes get compacted to shit and have a dead ride very quickly (e.g., Hoka Rincon and Mach 4), whereas other shoes have very resilient midsoles (e.g., older Adidas Boston's with Boost foam, most Brooks shoes, etc.). There's also some shoes with minimal/no outsoles where that's also a concern (e.g., Saucony Kinvara), especially if you've got a funky foot strike that causes significant concentrated wear.

I personally am somewhat sensitive to ride changes, but I'm light (57-60kg) and have a standard heel strike so most shoes have solid outsole coverage on my highest wear spots. This means that I can take most daily trainers to 800-1000km before retiring them, and lighter weight speed shoes to 500-700km. I think the average person can expect 600-800km on most daily trainers and 400-600km ish on lighter weight stuff. If you fall outside this range, you'd know it as you're either especially sensitive or aren't particularly so.",1,Reddit,adidas

metaverse,26/12/2021 12:31:42 AM,hpz06ya,"That is part of the key question. Let's call that the A to B question. That is,   First of all the use cases are a good starting point. If hou expertise is in games, the you should be asking what opportunities does the Metaverse offer, preferrable something that has been overlooked or for which you already have some IP for that works well. That is: Where am I now in terms of products and services, and Where do I want to get to? Sort of: How do I get from A to B. And you need to anticipat where others will be playing in this space. This is, in essence, the most simple view of the migration path. And a good migration pagh should allow changes to adapt to market changes. 

Beyond that we need to recognize that any product offering needs to be appropriate to the resources you that you can muster. Your approach should avoid patent and copyright pitfalls or you sill be spending a lot of time and money in court. IANAL, but clearly the use of contracts of adhestion have had problems that you may want to avoid. Companies with ""attractive"" products such as athletic collectables are moving toward botique or atelier product offerings. This is work environment that is production plus art srudio. Think about Andy Warhol's approach, maybe tied to blockchain or NFT. What I'm heading toward here is the case of brigading for arbitrage items. Nike suggests thag the virtual storefront may offer you a purchase price and a discount lprice. The discount price may require you to ""stroll"" through the store looking for clues or tokens. Once you have found the ones needed, you are eligible to the discount purchase price. Now, unbeknowst to Nike, 8 of your closest friends are watching over your shoulder. And now they are ready to sweep in to purchase the remaint stock of Larry Bird suspenders. Nike has to be aware of tge. How will they deal with this issue, or, is that to their advantage to have a supply chain of ezger collectors to support their marketing efforts. I believe it was Adidas that sold out their stick in record time, $22M in an afternoon using NFT's. (See The Verge) Now is that an arena you can play in, or one to be avoided? Clearly, the Metaverse is going to be complicated and challenging. I suggest you start collecting Use-Cases, they will form the backbone of the Metaverse.",1,Reddit,adidas

It was Christmas morning, and out of courtesy I let her know that I'm not wearing anything fancy because I want to be comfortable in adidas tracksuit, specially in Christmas. She proceeds to throw a tantrum about how she wanted me to look fancy and wanted to take pictures together, and proceeds blackmailing me to see if I would go all choked up in a tight suit. I got really angry that she was trying to have me be uncomfortable and tied up, because of a few pictures, and an argument broke loose.  
I asked her to stop the argument midway, because I wanted to cool-off before travelling to her place, but she kept on pressing the matter, and I couldn't bear with the direspect anymore, so I didn't go to her house for Christmas.

Look at Sandbox as an example. Most ‚ÄúGamers‚Äù are not invested there. Who bought up all the lands then? Atari, Adidas, Care Bears, just to name a few‚Ä¶.

Metaverse and NFT Gaming is going to be so much bigger than regular gaming. More regular people, businesses and investors will be getting involved *(and they are the ones with the money)*. Gamers won‚Äôt get into it until there is a legit revolutionary game that comes out. They will literally spend thousands of hours and money on a game where they will get absolutely nothing in return for it but a higher rank on their Gamer Board. Once a legit platform comes out *(GMErica)*, and they have real games to play, Gamers will start getting involved.

Or they don‚Äôt , and it won‚Äôt matter because Mass Adoption will take place. There have already been several very successful NFT games (Sandbox, Decentraland, Axie Infinity, Gods Unchained) to name a few. And these games are doing numbers.

stalker,25/12/2021 07:13:14 PM,hpxygy8,"Once again, I‚Äôm here to remind you dumbasses, *don‚Äôt screw with anomalies if you don‚Äôt know what the fuck you‚Äôre doing.*

Stalkers, when you encounter Anomalies, always make sure to identify the type first, so you know how to protect yourself. Thankfully, anomalies are very easy to distinguish. Burners cause the air around them to heat up, electro anomalies are a localised lightning storm, and many other ways exist to identify other different ones. Fair warning, don‚Äôt stick around toxic anomalies very long if you like the company of others. They smell like an *unholy* combination of death, ass, rotting flesh, durian fruit, cigarettes, asbestos, and *skunk.* And the smell sticks to you for a while. I once had to part ways with a good companion because he just smelled so bad. Shame, really. 

When you encounter an anomaly, you can take one of three paths of action. The first path is the path of least resistance; walking away. This won‚Äôt get you rich by any means, but it‚Äôs a (mostly) guaranteed way not to die where you stand. 

The second path of action is the Smart Way; get yourself a good detector, and a lot of bolts or small pebbles. Listen to the detector, and if in doubt, throw a bolt in the direction you‚Äôre going. And in a field of anomalies, remember to follow the *exact* path back out as the one you took in. This is the easiest and safest way to hunt artifacts. The better detector you have, the rarer artifacts you can find with it, and the better you get paid. 

And then there‚Äôs the third path; the Way of Pain. This is used by Stalkers who have a lot of ambition, and very little brain cells. Bandits and Renegades, I‚Äôm looking at you for this one. I was Stalking a Renegade for Colonel Petrenko. I tracked him to the Garbage, where I found him chilling with a group of bandits. They were marching towards Butcher‚Äôs train hangar, no doubt on their way to try and rob him blind. 
One of the Stalkers had a detector on him, and it started going off. Two bandits started panicking and throwing bolts in every direction. I was waiting for some of them to run straight into the anomaly field so I could finish the stragglers, but before I could even fire a shot, one of the bandits must have reached into his ammo bag by mistake. 

If you must throw something into an anomaly field, make sure it‚Äôs small, light, and for the love of fuck, *inert*. That idiot bandit threw a handful of LIVE ROUNDS into an *electrical* anomaly! It was either karma, or absolutely shitty luck, when one of the rounds was triggered by the anomaly, went off in midair, and shot the Renegade straight through the helmet. Then, as if that wasn‚Äôt enough, the anomaly itself apparently decided it was fed up with the smell of stale vodka and sweaty Adidas, and fried every man there alive. 

The Way of Pain; the Zone‚Äôs *other*, other bandit population control method. Works a treat.

Miami,25/12/2021 06:27:52 PM,hpxt8sm,"First of all, both Christie's and Sotheby's now sell NFTs alongside physical pieces. So there simply is widespread adoption. It not as a cash grab but because it's a really simple way to track provenance. Of course there's issues as well. But the main benefit is that you can ensure that a digital item is authentic. And this is a hybrid of both models. You sell a physical piece, with a traditional coa (a piece of paper) and this also contains a hash unique to the NFT. the peblem here I'll grant, is that the 3rd person to buy it, may keep the NFT, and sell the physical. There's nothing stopping him from doing that. However the buyer would likely request the coa which would contain verification that this is the original digital work. 

Also  I'm speaking of how the art world uses NFTs. They're not as interested in the massive PFP projects. Many of which will tank in value. The other elephant in the room is licensing.  One thing the Apes did which was super smart was to sell the licensing rights with the NFT. so that's why the face of Adidas is now GMoney. They bought it, so they can use it any way they want. This actually makes it simpler as compared to working with galleries and lawyers and artists to come to an agreement as to how to use the work.",1,Reddit,adidas

Look up Linksoul and look at their tees, they are Perfecto. 

I currently wear some broken down ae joggers that look kinda dumb, some jeans that are decently fitted. Barely any shorts and if I do wear them, it's usually at home. Cargo pants whenever I work, I also wear them normally though. A shit ton of sweatshirts and hoodies ranging in colors and brands; oh and a Rasta drug rug. Shirts are usually random brands and somewhat conform to my interests, my favorites are the linksouls I own though. Some jackets as well, I don't wear them much. 

My shoes, I own a pair of Jordan 4's, some Eddie Bauer water shoes, some hella comfy Walmart shoes that resemble a retarded Sperry boat shoe lined with fur, a pair of normal Sperry's, high top Vans that never get worn, some expensive boots that are waterproof but I wear them when doing outdoor work/hobbies which is never, Nike running shoes that I paid a decent amount for which are dedicated to working and not running like I bought them for.

Socks are usually adidas, puma, under armour, as well as some odd ones that contain designs like Scooby Doo. For Christmas I received about 20 pairs of socks to add though, they are mainly white with a couple being black and gray. 

I wear headwear constantly, mainly beanies whenever I can. Different brands on all. 

Underwear is Reebok, ae with random designs like Jason Voorhees, probably some Walmart brands as well. Recently got some lucky brand for Christmas that I will probably switch all of them to once I eventually get money for something like that.

Essentially it works as a controlled commodity within a controlled ecosystem. You have the game creator backing the nft for as long as they back the game itself, you have a trade economy with other player and a much more difficult (if not impossible?) to clone the item in question, hurting that economy. Pass the fees to the consumers trading and profit off that exchange every time.

Now, I don't fully understand the tech and I may be wrong about some assumptions, but the biggest thing I feel about all of it is that... No, this isn't something for consumers to get excited about. Nothing visually changes from what's there today. But it is something for the company to get excited about.

Now all of that is to say, most of these companies like Nike, Adidas, etc getting in on NFT seems very much like a play to get stores, and by proxy fashion, into the metaverses that are coming.

First of all let‚Äôs say one thing up front - no company can repress generational leaps in technology or they end up like Kodak. The future is inevitable. 

Blockchain is a generational leap in information transfer technology. If companies refuse to adapt to it they will be replaced by new companies who will. 

Besides that I think you need to realise the old ways of profiting off an entity aren‚Äôt the only ways. Blockchain offers new ways for companies to make money and they are already taking advantage of them. 

Disney can sell me a movie directly now as an NFT but they can also release the movie like a Willy Wonka bar where you might get a golden ticket that gives you these additional benefits. 

Arsenal can put your season ticket on the blockchain and they can reward you for attending games in arsenal tokens you can use in the stadium. 

Adidas can sell you shoes that give you access to a personalised training program once you‚Äôve completed 5 10k runs. 

Blockchain tech opens a lot of doors for companies - just because it used to be done one way doesn‚Äôt mean it continues to be that way.

lululemon,25/12/2021 11:26:11 AM,hpwp4xk,"The older lululemon items are def super durable and long lasting. The current era items? Unfortunately not so much hence why I‚Äôve been sad about lululemon. üò≠Their quality was vastly different even 5 years ago compared to quality of today. 

I flirt with a lot of brands and like different brands for different reasons. 

I like Michi, Koral, Heroine Sport, Alala, Alo and Wolven for thot athletic wear because sometimes looking hot at the gym is what I‚Äôm going for even if these brands don‚Äôt have the best quality. 

I like sweaty Betty for yoga, run, ski/snowboard more than lululemon‚Äôs current era due to what I feel is better consistent qualify (all I buy from lululemon now are align tanks and high neck masks, crop tanks, wunder unders when old pairs wear out though RIP, wunder trains when old pairs wear out, a jogger here and there, and misc item here and there)

I like 2XU for performance competition clothing like for BJJ, TKD matches, marathons and tris. As well as some TKD and BJJ niche brands. 

I like beyond yoga also for yoga as well as for comfort wear. 

I like ultracor, Lucas Hugh for luxury performance gear that works well and looks good, but only when on sale since these brands are stupidly priced. 

I like Tory Sport for tennis. 

I like Live The Process for barre and Pilates. 

I like Roxy for basic surf gear though I buy niche surf brands for less uber girly looking technical stuff. 

I also own a good measure of Athleta, Nike, Adidas, Under Armor, Outdoor Voicss because these brands are good for basics that do the job well even if they look boring. And OV used to have sample sales in NYC so buying $30 tights that perform pretty well was nice at the time. They haven‚Äôt had own in a while üò≠

femalefashionadvice,25/12/2021 05:33:48 AM,hpw1ark,"As a person that actually went to parties in the 80s it would depend on the party.

For rock punk and new age parties I wore very tight jeans, converse sneakers  and ripped black band (the cure, the kinks. The The or Kiss) teashirt, leather wrist bands, studded multi belts and leather chokers.

Or I wore throwback mod/punk clothes- flats, ripped tights, black and white pencil skirt and white blouse with a peter pan collar, think to sir with love or 60s London.

I also wore a lot of retro 50s party dresses with glitter heels.

For soul or pop parties I'd  wear a glittery slinky jumpsuit, or a lace jumpsuit with ankle boots, lots of chunky jewelry or a tuxedo jacket, a slinky haltertop, tap pants, fishnets and mary janes (think rocky horror picture show).

For a super casual party I'd  go with Adidas track pants or camouflage pants, a knit teeshirt and Vans or deck shoes.",1,Reddit,adidas

Kids these days will never know about the epic ads of 10, 15, 20 years ago.

Nothing on the internet will ever give me as much joy again as browsing the joga bonito sites by Nike when I was young. Anyone remember these sites?

IIRC they released the videos weekly one by one and articles on up and coming stars were very interesting to read and scroll through. 

I distinctly remember the site about Nuri Sahin, how he grew up and that he played on a hill as a child. [Whoever made it up that hill first won the game.](https://youtu.be/6U3CJ-9rN7E). 

A few of the Joga Bonito videos:

* [What is Joga Bonito? That can only be answered with your feet.](https://youtu.be/8WBIaumsvbo), ""the chain"". For this video you could send in your own clips at the start of the campaign and they made a video with people all over the world out of it. Then they chained these together.

* [Footballer without skills is like a crepes without the filling, empty.](https://youtu.be/Ed-s4C50vL4) 

* the most famous one - [Ronaldinho and the bar](https://youtu.be/IPSNtatlikQ). Was it faked? Yes. Did I still try to convince everyone in school that it was real? Also yes. If anyone could do it, he can.

* [Ronaldo's answer](https://youtu.be/2gfH-vcsnKc), ""kiddo, the ball has to go into the net, not onto the bar, understood?"" 

* [Here's to Roooonaldooooooooo](https://youtu.be/q56rf9Dzcr4)

* [Never grow up, my friends.](https://youtu.be/-Evi9y74A0s), the childhood footage of Ronaldinho was epic

* Who could forget all the great clips with Cantona raving on about football and 'ow it shud be plaid - [a compilation](https://youtu.be/ESHZxUloUUw)

* [You can sing like a canary but only if you know how to play in an orchestra you can make beautiful music](https://youtu.be/xFp7btucv58), the magnificent Mas que nada Brazil video 

* [Make the ball 'appy](https://youtu.be/DP6es-JGp-E)

* [Three Brazilians and a football, that's all you need](https://youtu.be/TJU31rqlSiE)

* [Football is like fencing - CR7 vs Bald Zlatan](https://youtu.be/krenRc91aE0)

* [Can Zlatan do kick ups with a chewing gum?](https://youtu.be/SntDhuTMVbM), even a funny cameo of his dad

* [Liars and Cheaters](https://youtu.be/Wlm9MRVER3E)

* [If you want to be an actor, then move to Hollywood](https://youtu.be/NiU3otwMvC4)

* [People 'ave forgotten what honour is with Henry](https://youtu.be/xzCLGpDSrhE), watch out for him getting absolutely done by an elastico

* [Play Joga 3, 3vs3 with Rio, Rooney, Robbie Keane](https://youtu.be/q1OJWiTUfXU) and of course a CR7 tap in decides the game just before the end

* [Tevez](https://youtu.be/B3saBDIcHpM), never seen this one before

* That Jeremy guy from these F2 guys meeting [Zlatan, CR7 and Ronaldinho](https://youtu.be/tBOwvxQR044), lucky cunt

Propably the best marketing campaign ever in football, I loved it.

No, an NFT entire purpose is to convey the right of ownership over the work. That doesn't mean someone else can't copy the art and create a new NFT pointing at that art. But then it's a different NFT. How that is used is the next step. As it is a digital product its impact in the physical world is, like you said, smaller. But say printing companies start making it hard for folks to print digital art that matches a compendium of well known and validated NFT's? Or Nike/Adidas will sell custom shoe designs based on your NFT? Or games provide extra features based on that NFT? Or some popular MMO allows you to put your NFT's as art in your virtual house? Suddenly there's a possible value.

Honestly I personally think all the examples I gave I wouldn't care about. Except maybe art in my virtual house in some global Matrix/Ready Player One style MMO.",1,Reddit,adidas

socialskills,25/12/2021 02:07:01 AM,hpvi0b2,"Should have worn a Speedo bathing suit and nothing else.  I'm just kidding, I'm wearing Adidas pants right now, so comfortable!

For a wedding, funeral, formal dinner, golf outing, most people will dress to the occasion.  I was in corporate sales my whole life, had to wears suits.  Hated it at first, but then I adapted and found a suit brand that was comfortable.

Building social skills involves changing, and sometimes doing things that we don't want to do.  I have a brother in law who shows up at family functions wearing a white stained tee and fat man shorts.  He's a fucking slob, cares not a wit for anyone, not for his kids or wife.  His kids are all out of college, engineers, doctors, won't give him the time of day.  Make fun of him to his face.  You are showing up to show your love of your friend who lost his father, dressing like a bum (which is how I dress most days too) is not demonstrating good social skills.  It's NOT about you, it's about your friends loss and respecting the cultural norms.  I would golf in a Speedo if I could get away with it.

Clothing is commonly used as a way to distinguish the working class. In the UK the slur is chavs, those wearing adidas 3 stripe and gold chains. You made a judgement based on their clothing.

I placed class before race as that seemed more applicable to what you had written. Judging based on competency deals with both issues. But with that said, the clothing of other races has long been used as a way to discriminate as well. We see this in the UK when people are wearing more stereotypically muslim attire are vitctimised.

h3h3productions,25/12/2021 01:01:12 AM,hpvbp7h,"Okay cool man So then how isnt it the responsibility of parents to then raise their kids to understand the risks of gambling? All this comes down to parenting. Even the stuff I said.   
You just choose to be ignorant to the double standard.   
If youre not aware of the effects of gambling over the age of 18 youre the one requiring critical thinking classes, I feel no shit sorry for you if a guy winning 100k after losing over half of it triggers to you as a get rich quick scheme.   
Also ethen not saying the video was a joke is as effective as a ""do not try this at home"".

  
 But I get it, keep kissing ethens ass bro you love him, You probably posses some of his mannerisms. You probably talk like him   
Also, who are these people you are talking about? It sounds like youre pulling it out of your ass from a ""Well theirs over 100k people watching. at least one persons going to think its a good way to make money''. 

  
 One person or maybe 5 or 10. Thats not enough to acknowledge it as a problem of the streamer instead of the person who is watching and choosing to make that interpretation and mistake. 

  
also once again where are your parents when you were a kid to tell you it was bad  
 Also are these people to stupid to look up and check the validity and the history of the site to make sure they arent getting scammed?  IF not then I don't give a fuck if they lose money That's their fault.   
Oh my goodness A company using a public figure to advertise their business? How has this never been done before? Explain the difference to me of coke advertising a drink that can kill you from consuming over a period of time compared to an activity that can kill you the same way.  
Casinos, Clubs, Every fucking business using physiological manipulation tactics to get you to buy in, But you draw the line when they sponsor someone to gamble on their site.  
Its exactly that, its a sponsor. Train gambles no matter what.  
This company paying him to do their gambling, shows off their website, Shows off the games they offer. Regardless if train takes their opportunity he's playing.  
Its like being a contracted MMA fighter.  
And Omg they are making money too? holy shit Does that actually fucking surprise you? 

26% of the whole world gambles. even my parents went to vegas to gamble for fun knowing they wouldn't make shit on slots. People gamble for thrill  


of 350 million people in Canada, 0.00028571428 Gamble with Super high risk plays. Thats pretty fucking low. Train Streaming it has no effect on the worlds surplus of gambling addicts only the surplus of people going on the site. 

  
Now of that number that whole bullshit people think its a get rich quick scheme explain that to me?  
Stop crying about gambling and teach people to be smart with their money.  
""But its offshore bro"" Yeah Less restrictions thats the point, so that can be great but Also that could mean absolute disaster for someone using the site.

  
 So once again if you arent fucking stupid you'll check the validity of the site before you use it.   


Also here's a fun fact for your thick skull here's some offshore companies that are based in the united states, Nike, Adidas, Coke, Apple. All these companies use multinational tactics to get away with certain practices.   
Trainwrecks is given money to gamble on the site, He could either lose it all or make money.  
Ie Gambling  
""Oh my god he's making money promoting a product, Every streamer does the same thing.""  


Streamers YouTubers and celebrities promote toxic Products to their viewers? Hows that not any worse then gambling? The way I see it more kids are affected by gfuel then gambling.   


I like how you painted the responsibility of kids watching his streams on Trainwrecks instead of the parent who should be monitoring the kids behaviour online. Gambling isnt a source of income.

  
Wow thats funny, I can change out certain words you said and it will sound like the exact same thing yet you refuse to acknowledge that.

Sneakers,24/12/2021 10:35:21 PM,hpuw156,"Actually a decent time to ask me that question because I finally picked up a pair of 990v5 a few weeks back! So the 990 is generally considered to be the flagship NB sneaker. It was originally introduced as a high end running shoe back in 1982. It was also the first running shoe to retail at $100 so it‚Äôs always been a premium sneaker. They‚Äôre part of of the NB Made collection which means they are made here in the USA which is definitely a reason for the high price tag. Anyways, over the years NB has continued to revise the 990 and we‚Äôre currently at v5 with v6 slated to come out sometime next year.

So I will agree with most people that the 990v5 is an incredibly comfortable sneaker. It doesn‚Äôt have instant super-plush underfoot feeling that many modern sneakers have. I‚Äôm talking about sneakers using materials like Adidas Boost or Nike Zoom X as the main cushion. The problem with having ultra-soft material underfoot is that it can start causing fatigue in your feet after extended periods of walking or standing. For a short walk to the store, sure the super soft feeling is nice but it‚Äôs not generally what you want to have if you‚Äôll be on your feet all day long. That‚Äôs where a shoe like the 990v5 comes in. The initial feeling on-foot isn‚Äôt as plush as something like Boost, but what it does provide is support and stability for your feet which means you can comfortably wear them all day long. I‚Äôve found this to be the case as well. If I know I‚Äôll be walking all day long, the 990v5 would be my first choice. On top of that, the upper has lots of mesh for excellent breathability and soft suede for flexibility. 

Now of course everyone‚Äôs feet is different and I‚Äôm sure there are some people who would prefer to walk around in Boost all day. And technologies like Boost and Zoom X certainly have their place. I‚Äôm just speaking in general terms here. What I can say is that I‚Äôm thoroughly pleased with my 990v5s even with the high price tag. Not to mention I like the fact that they‚Äôre made in the US. Now I need to resist the urge to buy another version, maybe the 990v3 or something like the 993‚Ä¶

If stereotypes are true then are all russians drunk smokers wearing adidas track suits? Are french people all artists that love baguettes? Are all germans nazis and no humor goody two shoes? Are africans still living in caves and going ‚Äúgooga booga‚Äù?

welcometorockville,24/12/2021 08:07:53 PM,hpue5ew,"In all honestly, your best shoe is going to have a good outsole and midsole construction. You can usually mitigate poor midsole construction with shoe inserts, but you won't be able to substitute bad outsole construction. All cheap big box retail sneakers (Target, Walmart, Payless, etc.), most Converses^1, and some Doc Martins^2 will kill your feet because they have poor outsole and midsole construction. Also, never wear new shoes. You need to know if the shoes have pressure points and rub points before you wear them for 12+ hours a day. Ankle support is a personal preference since there's no rough or uneven terrain (*side note: I'm talking about mountain and creek type uneven terrain, not there was gradual 6 inch slope somewhere in the field*). 

You're going to find the best midsole and outsole construction in Nikes, Sketchers, Adidas, and work boots/shoes targeted towards construction workers and nurses. You might also have luck looking at shoes meant for hikers or horse ranchers. What ever way you go, you're probably not going to find good shoes under $40 USD, unless they're on clearance/sale. 

Personally, I wear steele toed work boots because I like the mosh pits and up front crowds. If you buy work boots from a big box store (like Target or Walmart), then I suggest adding in insoles because the midsole construction on them is not great. Also, don't simply replace the insoles, you actually need two sets since the midsole construction is lacking so much. 

^1 - most Converses don't have midsoles, which is probably why most people report foot pain after 6+ hours of standing even with added insoles. 

^2 - A note on Doc Martin's: They're not all terrible. In fact, the vegan ones have the comparatively best outsole and midsole construction. However, a lot of them aren't great construction wise and it can be really difficult to tell if you're getting a good one or a bad one. Their high price mostly comes from their brand name and not their construction (sorta like Converses).",1,Reddit,adidas

vegan,24/12/2021 07:47:27 PM,hpubklq,"This is another typical argument against veganism, hypocritical (not necessarily more than others) of course, and it often comes from people that do not rely on animal farming to put food on the table for their families.   
It is also probably one the most used arguments by the BIG FOOD industry to justify the ""necessity"", the ""importance"" and ""widespread benefits"" of their atrocities, it is broadly and aggressively advertised, this is in fact where all these people get it from. They escape with anything by using it, with all the unimaginable atrocities, they all in fact turn into ‚Äúheroes‚Äù. And people love it, they embrace it, they think they ‚Äúindeed‚Äù have a moral argument for what they are doing ‚Äì they support ‚Äúhumans‚Äù. Of course, the argument is schizophrenical, you cannot justify an immoral activity just because it is beneficial to some. Whenever you support an industry, a company, a particular segment of the economy you also go against a different one. You support the animal farmers you go against the other farmers that cultivate fruits and vegies (they are humans too). The more animal products you consume the less plant-based ones you do, and such you negatively affect the lives and livelihoods of those other type of farmers. And this is valid with anything else, you buy an iPhone you do it in a detrimental way to Samsung, you buy Nike shoes do it in a detrimental way to Adidas, and so on.

uruguay,24/12/2021 04:14:40 PM,hptk3x2,"[...]mo trabajamos con la Florida y no con la costa este no tuvimos tantos problemas. Fue costoso, eso s√≠. Lo de Asia s√≠ nos afect√≥ much√≠simo, no solo a nivel de la mercader√≠a sino tambi√©n del mobiliario. Esta tienda (de Victoria‚Äôs Secret en Uruguay) debi√≥ abrir hace un mes, pero todo se retras√≥. Otro punto es que muchas f√°bricas textiles en Asia estuvieron cerradas por COVID-19 durante largos per√≠odos y eso nos afect√≥ mucho, porque hay colecciones que inclusive no se pudieron hacer. La manufactura se vio golpeada por el cierre de f√°bricas y despu√©s por los fletes.

**La digitalizaci√≥n del retail va m√°s all√° de montar un sitio de comercio electr√≥nico. Empiezan a abrirse nuevas posibilidades a trav√©s de la realidad aumentada, por ejemplo. ¬øQu√© planes tiene el grupo en incursionar en ese plano?**

El cat√°logo virtual y las compras virtuales se han venido manejando desde antes de la pandemia. Eso nos da mucha m√°s velocidad a la hora de comprar y la experiencia es bastante aceptada, no est√° tan lejos de cuando tienes la muestra f√≠sica. Nosotros estamos haciendo preventa en la cual nuestros clientes reciben la presentaci√≥n de la mercanc√≠a virtual. Las marcas siempre est√°n en constante an√°lisis. Adidas es vanguardista, por ejemplo, ya utiliz√≥ probadores virtuales en sus tiendas. Nosotros somos replicadores de marca, entonces, cuando nos den el OK y la instrucci√≥n, lo haremos. Cuando toque el momento de entrar a la realidad virtual, ah√≠ vamos a estar.

**¬øC√≥mo funciona la presentaci√≥n virtual de productos a la que se refer√≠a?**

Hay marcas como Adidas o American Eagle que tienen un sistema en el cual se baja la colecci√≥n y los compradores pueden ir viendo y combinando colores, indumentarias, accesorios, y vas creando tu propio outfit para poder hacer la compra. Despu√©s, si subimos el nivel, por ejemplo, tuve una presentaci√≥n de la indumentaria para el Mundial (2022) hace poco, que fue con realidad virtual. Te pon√≠as los lentes y estabas en el estadio y ve√≠as la indumentaria. Evidentemente, todav√≠a eso no sale al p√∫blico.

**¬øQu√© tiene que pasar para que eso madure? Imagino que ese tipo de experiencia conlleva el riesgo de que, si sale mal, la marca puede perder al consumidor.**

Si la experiencia no es buena y si la calidad de lo que viste cuando lo recibes no es tal, hay una promesa incumplida. Pero esto es algo que cada d√≠a est√° mejorando y hay grandes avances. La tecnolog√≠a va m√°s r√°pido que incluso el fast fashion, que es algo que cambia d√≠a a d√≠a.

**Panam√° es un reconocido polo log√≠stico y de negocios. ¬øQu√© posibilidades hay para las empresas uruguayas de insertarse con √©xito all√≠?**

S√≠ hay posibilidades y son grandes. Existe un portafolio interesante en Uruguay y Argentina -creo que los dos pa√≠ses van bastante ligados- de marcas que tienen todo para ser de las mejores. Tienen calidad y dise√±o y pueden competir con cualquiera. El tema es el conocimiento de marca. No es secreto que Centroam√©rica y la parte alta de Sudam√©rica est√°n muy influenciadas por EE.UU., entonces hay que darle la vuelta, tratar de ir subiendo y mostrar lo que se hace y c√≥mo se hace. Hemos hablado con varias compa√±√≠as interesadas en ver si hacen un joint venture o algo por el estilo. Lo estamos evaluando, porque creemos que hay potencialidades interesant√≠simas. No se trata de llegar solo a Panam√°, desde all√≠ puedes crecer hacia Centroam√©rica y Sudam√©rica alta.

Con m√°s de 40 a√±os de trayectoria, Grupo David creci√≥ en el negocio de la venta minorista desde Panam√° (donde tiene su sede; la empresa naci√≥ en Venezuela) hacia el resto de Latinoam√©rica de la mano de famosas marcas internacionales. Acaba de instalarse en Uruguay con la apertura de Victoria‚Äôs Secret y Bath &amp; Body Works. De visita en Montevideo, Marcano (venezolano, 41 a√±os) destac√≥ el clima de negocios que ofrece el pa√≠s, aunque alert√≥ sobre los altos costos de importaci√≥n. Pese a ello, el grupo ya explora la **apertura de American Eagle en 2022**. El ejecutivo abri√≥ la puerta a que marcas uruguayas lleguen a Panam√° y desde all√≠ se catapulten al resto de Centroam√©rica.   

**Grupo David inici√≥ sus operaciones en Uruguay con la llegada de Victoria‚Äôs Secret y Bath &amp; Body Works. ¬øQu√© condiciones encontraron en el mercado para avanzar con esos proyectos?**

Una condici√≥n, evidentemente, es el conocimiento de marca (de Victoria‚Äôs Secret). Era algo que el p√∫blico quer√≠a desde hac√≠a mucho tiempo, porque conoce la marca y no sab√≠a por qu√© no estaba en el pa√≠s. Hay un mercado que deseaba el producto y lo esperaba.

**¬øC√≥mo percibieron el escenario en la categor√≠a de lencer√≠a, perfumes y accesorios donde act√∫a Victoria‚Äôs Secret?**

Victoria‚Äôs Secret es l√≠der mundial y vende una experiencia totalmente distinta a lo que hay en el mercado. Somos promotores de innovaci√≥n, manejamos much√≠simas campa√±as y much√≠sima adaptabilidad a distintos mercados y tambi√©n a la mujer. Entonces, somos pioneros de lo que es nuevo, de lo que en verdad est√° de moda. Creo que hay una oferta interesante en el pa√≠s, con buenas marcas, pero nosotros tenemos una variedad o un portafolio much√≠simo m√°s grande que lo hay en el mercado.

**Este tipo de marcas llegan precedidas de un estudio del pa√≠s donde se instalar√°n. ¬øQu√© detectaron en Uruguay?**

La estabilidad econ√≥mica es super importante y m√°s teniendo vecinos que son inflacionarios. Ese tema es muy bien manejado aqu√≠ y la tasa de cambio tambi√©n es favorable, se mantiene. La seguridad jur√≠dica es de las m√°s s√≥lidas de la regi√≥n. Y el acompa√±amiento del gobierno es muy importante y colaborativo, en t√©rminos de que quieren que las empresas extranjeras hagan inversiones en Uruguay. Los proyectos tienen ciertas facilidades de inversi√≥n y de recuperaci√≥n a trav√©s de cr√©ditos fiscales y eso est√° muy bien elaborado e invita a que la gente venga a invertir. Impositivamente es caro, pero como est√° la econom√≠a ‚Äîm√°s all√° de que no sabemos si se quejan o no los uruguayos‚Äî creemos que, compar√°ndolo con los vecinos, el pa√≠s se ve bien. El poder adquisitivo del consumidor es de los mejores de la regi√≥n. Entonces, vemos la mezcla perfecta para que sea un buen negocio, un win-win tanto para el consumidor como para nosotros.

**Como inversor, ¬øqu√© puntos podr√≠an mejorarse?**

Las importaciones son costosas. El nivel de inversi√≥n que hay que hacer al final se recupera, pero es fuerte. Cuando tienes mercader√≠as o materiales importados y los precios son altos, tienes que tener una proyecci√≥n m√°s o menos del mismo monto para pago de impuestos. Creo que resta al momento de hacer inversiones, tiendas y conceptos m√°s grandes donde tienes que volcar m√°s plata.

**El grupo representa a diversas marcas internacionales. ¬øC√≥mo arm√≥ ese portafolio?**

Esto es un trabajo de 40 a√±os en retail. Es un grupo que tiene bastante conocimiento. Somos replicadores de marcas, somos sus partners. Entonces, un aspecto clave es tratar de siempre hacer la r√©plica perfecta de lo que las marcas tienen en sus sedes centrales. Eso ha creado un prestigio y reputaci√≥n. Las marcas se cuidan, se quieren y se trabajan. Hay que demostrar que es no solo tener la marca, sino representarla como tal. Si ve nuestro portafolio, tratamos de que las marcas no compitan entre s√≠. Tenemos equipos separados y dedicados para que cada una tenga su importancia. Todas son de p√∫blicos, segmentos o tipos diferentes. Eso tambi√©n es una virtud para poder garantizar de que todo vaya mucho mejor. Solo coincidimos con Adidas y Reebok, porque Adidas hasta el a√±o que viene es due√±o de Reebok. En el resto, tenemos ropa de ni√±os con The Children's Place; para j√≥venes con American Eagle, productos para damas con Victoria‚Äôs Secret, hogar con Bath &amp; Body Works y zapatos y accesorios con Clarks.

**¬øYa tienen planes para otros lanzamientos en Uruguay?**

Queremos incorporar lo m√°s r√°pido posible American Eagle, que est√° creciendo a ritmo de doble d√≠gito, inclusive pospandemia. El p√∫blico la quiere y le ha ganado much√≠simo terreno a sus cl√°sicos competidores. Es cuesti√≥n de tiempo que aterricemos la marca en Uruguay.

**¬øSer√° el a√±o pr√≥ximo?**

S√≠, todo depende del acuerdo y las locaciones. Es vital la ubicaci√≥n, el espacio y, si tenemos eso, lo haremos en 2022. Luego, hay un plan de crecimiento a medida de que aparezcan locaciones para Victoria‚Äôs Secret y Bath &amp; Body Works.

**Las marcas miran a Montevideo como primer mercado y suelen elegir los shoppings para instalarse. ¬øQu√© opciones barajan para llegar al Interior o abrir en locales a la calle?**

En Punta del Este hay que estar; ser√° cuesti√≥n de que se d√© el crecimiento natural. Hoy comenzamos a trabajar con Victoria‚Äôs Secret y Bath &amp; Body Works y eso nos dar√° m√°s data de c√≥mo es el comportamiento del Interior y d√≥nde debemos tener m√°s tiendas. Montevideo es una ciudad grande, con buenos centros comerciales y operadores y siempre hay conversaciones para ver d√≥nde abrir las pr√≥ximas tiendas.

**Los planes pasan por abrir tiendas f√≠sicas. ¬øC√≥mo influye en esa estrategia el boom del e-commerce, que se dispar√≥ durante la pandemia?**

Es evidente el crecimiento que est√° teniendo ese canal que mucha gente no utilizaba porque quer√≠a la experiencia de tienda. Nosotros vendemos experiencia de tienda. Sin embargo, apuntamos a que para 2024 nuestras ventas digitales sean el 20% del total (hoy son el 10%), y que sigan complementando a la experiencia de ir a la tienda. En nuestros an√°lisis de datos, vemos cruces entre compra digital y compra en tienda. Hemos creado desde el a√±o pasado 17 sitios de e-commerce en la regi√≥n. Y todos han sumado valor.

**¬øQu√© barreras persisten para que el consumidor se vuelque m√°s al e-commerce?**

Hay dos cosas que los operadores tenemos que mejorar. Los tiempos de entrega tienen que ser algo que debemos tratar de garantizar. El consumidor quiere las cosas ya, no para dentro de dos d√≠as. Lo otro son las devoluciones. Eso es lo m√°s dif√≠cil. Los lapsos de la log√≠stica inversa se pueden transformar en unos cuantos d√≠as para que el cliente tenga su nuevo producto. Quien pueda dominar el tiempo de entrega y la log√≠stica inversa va a dominar (en online).

**¬´El ‚Äò√°ngel‚Äô no representaba 100% a nuestro cliente¬ª**

Este a√±o, Victoria‚Äôs Secret lanz√≥ ¬´VS Collective¬ª, su grupo de portavoces integrado por referentes con perfiles m√°s diversos que el de los famosos ¬´√°ngeles¬ª, las modelos que han llevado tradicionalmente sus prendas. ¬øQu√© efecto ha tenido ese cambio?

El mundo ha cambiado y ahora Victoria‚Äôs Secret tiene el VS Collective, un equipo completo que tambi√©n son ¬´√°ngeles¬ª, pero no en el sentido tradicional (de la marca) sino en lo que de verdad es la diversidad de la mujer. Tenemos a deportistas, representantes de la protecci√≥n de los derechos humanos, grandes portadoras de la moda, mujeres de tallas m√°s grandes, del colectivo LGBT... O sea, de verdad representa lo que somos todos. La figura del ¬´√°ngel¬ª es bonita, pero no era el 100% de nuestro cliente, no estaba (representado) el 100% de lo que es la mujer en la tienda. Ahora s√≠ est√°n todas. Creo que este cambio era algo que debi√≥ haber sucedido hace tiempo. Sin embargo, es un proceso de transformar la imagen, de c√≥mo va avanzando la marca y c√≥mo nos vamos adaptando a lo nuevo, a lo que dicta el mercado. 

**¬øC√≥mo afect√≥ la pandemia el negocio del grupo?**

El a√±o 2020 fue muy complicado, tuvimos pa√≠ses que pasaron hasta seis meses cerrados comercialmente, y eso fue bastante fuerte e impactante para el negocio. Sin embargo, la recuperaci√≥n de 2021 nos lleva a n√∫meros superiores a 2019 en todos los mercados. Hoy estamos arriba de 15% respecto a 2019, lo cual es un n√∫mero super importante para el tama√±o de nuestro negocio. Podemos decir que (el resultado) ha superado las expectativas. Inclusive no solo Grupo David, sino muchas marcas han crecido en hasta dos d√≠gitos. Hay que pensar qu√© va a pasar cuando se estabilice un poco m√°s la econom√≠a y se sacie ese mercado que estuvo cerrado tanto tiempo. Viviremos eso el a√±o que viene. Creo que vamos a seguir creciendo, pero no a la misma velocidad.

**El COVID-19 distorsion√≥ el transporte de carga a nivel global, especialmente en China. ¬øC√≥mo repercuti√≥ ese factor en las operaciones del grupo y en sus aperturas?**

Ah√≠ hay dos variantes: tenemos los productos que vienen de Asia y los que vienen de EE.UU. El producto de EE.UU. lo pudimos recibir en los tiempos que normalmente trabajamos, a pesar de que hubo colapso en los puertos del pa√≠s. Co[...]

Honestly not much of a sale from it but it did fill up the space. 

There was a Performance Parts company wanted to rent a small space in our shop. And the deal was rent + split profit as well as they request us to handle the sale if any comes as they won't provide staff. The sales cover some of the bills.

So you are on the right track to get a brand/store to partner with you. Just find automotive related or fashion related to the Automotive / Motorsport like Adidas Motorsport, OMP, .etc.

We had an approach by a cafe operator wanted to rent a space out of us as well but for that case we just don't have enough space.

As for tournaments, just ask straight up money as sponsorship of the tournament is the easiest. And give them Tier so the Title Sponsor is also entitled to provide products used as prizes.

1. Don‚Äôt fall for their gendered advertising 
2. Act when you have to act but don‚Äôt believe it 
3. Fundamentally do your own thing

/

1. buy as much stuff from the men‚Äôs section as you can. I‚Äôm talking skinny jeans razors sweatshirts body soap socks flannels. I even buy a type of solid mens cologne that‚Äôs largely beeswax and other things which I use to smooth down flyaway hairs in my ponytail. The scent is called Naval Diplomacy lmao but I think it smells good. And it works great for my intended purpose. Buy shoes (like my go-to, adidas superstars) in men‚Äôs sizes, you‚Äôll get half off sometimes because it‚Äôs such an uncommon size for men. Buy men‚Äôs boxers, pajama pants, even shirts if they can fit, you can lounge in them. And the women‚Äôs stuff, buy as comfortable things as you can. Comfy bras, comfy underwear, etc. 

2. embrace the discrepancy between your true self and the play acting you do. Your true self is who you are when you are safe, with people who accept you regardless of your performative femininity or lack thereof. Anything you do when you are alone is you. I shave underarm hair because I smell better like that and it‚Äôs more comfortable for me, I do it even when nobody will see, so that‚Äôs not a performance, it‚Äôs a personal choice. Mascara though? That‚Äôs a decoration. It‚Äôs a choice I make when I go on a date (still a choice, although a societally supported one, which shaving is too) and it‚Äôs a choice I make at work, but less willingly. And then decide what you do 100% because you have to. Heels with suits used to be that for me but I‚Äôve now found professional boots to replace that part of my wardrobe because heels hurt my feet. But yeah for a while I wore heels and hated them just because I felt I had to. It didn‚Äôt make me weak for caving to society‚Äôs pressure it made sense for where I was at the time in my life. But like I said‚Ä¶ I knew I was just dressing up and doing what was expected of me until I had the freedom to choose differently. 

3. here‚Äôs perhaps the most important part: find something to do that they don‚Äôt want you to do. A little rebellion or a big one. Men‚Äôs cologne or a male-dominated career or underwire-free bras or anything you want. Do. Your. Own. Thing.",1,Reddit,adidas

lesbian,24/12/2021 02:51:43 AM,hprgx5p,"I am a lesbian agender afab and a minor in highschool. In May of this year I confessed to a girl I really liked via a love letter I slipped into her locker. She said yes and for a while things were great. It was the end of the school year and the only time we could hang out was during lunch time which was very nice actually. So school ends and the only way we were communicating was through Instagram. She made a second secret account (which later became her art account) because her mom was super homophobic and monitored her main account.  Through that account we were able to arrange to meet up during a school event that I had to attend because of choir and she had to attend because she had signed up to volunteer to help. 

Her brother also attended and happens to catch sight of my shoes. Adidas came out with a pair of shoes where the inside had a rainbow pattern and on the outside there's a rainbow heart. Her brother uses this to tell her parents that she has a friend who is probably gay. Her mom finds about about the secret account and for about two weeks I don't hear anything from the girl. 

Long story short... She manages to get back both of her Instagram accounts and starts posting. Never contacted me. Never tried to reach out.

camping,23/12/2021 07:25:27 PM,hppujnd,"&gt;  Say you‚Äôre out for 10 days, that‚Äôs $300 on socks in most cases.

No, because I would wear one pair and take another pair on a 10 day trip and rotate them. You don't need to wear fresh clothing every day in the woods. If it's cold, you're not going to sweat heavily and stink things up. Wool clothing doesn't retain odors. 

A few drops of castile soap and a container of water is all you need to refresh a shirt, undies, or socks. Wring it out, whip it around, whatever to get the excess water out then let it air dry.

My favorite outdoors pants were $20 at Costco, once I tried out a single pair and liked them, I went back and got 3 more. I wear them ALL THE TIME, had them since 2015. My favorite midlayer is a half zip that I got for around $20 at Kohl's. My favorite undies, Adidas Climalite, were around $20 for a 3 pack at Target. Shorts? I think either Kohl's or Target.  Both have great workout gear that adapts well to the outdoors. 

You can get great stuff at thrift shops, you can shop REI's garage sale. REI is awesome, but it's an expensive retailer, there are simply other places to shop. It takes more time and you won't have the latest Arc'teryx wonder fabric...but you'll be fine. \

The only thing I don't skimp on is socks, I get Darn Toughs and when I see them on sale I buy at least 2-3 pair. I was at an REI last weekend, got some for $16. Ask for them for Christmas.

Nike has a tick as their logo. The tick looks like a swish and a wing, both of which indicating speed and success respectively.

If so, or if there is a number that would make this flaw worth the buy, maybe propose that to the seller instead of a return.  Just a thought.

hockeyplayers,23/12/2021 05:30:13 PM,hppe3dk,"This is something I'm in the middle of putting together a review on. 



Growing up I would play in boxers and that was it. Of course, I also didn't air out my gear or wash it. As an adult I've always worn long sleeve top/bottom. For the last 5 or so years I've used TSLA branded gear I got on Amazon. For the price, it's been amazing! Back when I bought them, tops/bottoms combined were probably only $25. Insane price especially for the quality and how long they've lasted. I have a highly ventilated versions of tops/bottoms that I can't currently find on Amazon, but there are similar ones. For the price, these are a no brainer. They're not hockey specific and don't always help keep your elbow pads in place, but they breathe amazingly well and are inexpensive.  



https://www.amazon.com/TSLA-Sleeve-T-Shirt-Baselayer-Compression/dp/B081Q98XY8



Next up is Shock Doctor which is hockey specific. There are two different versions, but the primary one I'm focusing on has the sleeves that fold over your elbow pads. The shirt is made from traditional compression material that hugs your body nicely. There are silicone patches on the elbows to help keep your pads in place. They also have a sleeve that folds over the lower part of your elbows to further keep them in place. They're really nice and useful. Downside is they run a bit warm as the primary ventilation is under the arms, but that's about it. Wish they had a large back panel of mesh or something like that. If you play in a cold rink, this is a great option. Price-wise, these are $50-60 which I feel is a fair price to pay. 



https://www.hockeymonkey.com/shock-doctor-undergarment-core-hockey-shirt-sr.html




On the high end of the spectrum is Warroad which I just picked up. Haven't played in this yet since the league is on a holiday break, but here are my initial thoughts. The whole concept of their brand is to be tight in the arms and loose in the body. I'm not exactly a fan of this as I'd prefer to have a shirt that's tight all over. I sized down to help this, but then the sleeves are too tight so I guess I just need to deal with a looser fit. The entire body is made of a very light air mesh type material. Crazy breathable and I have no doubt these will feel great on the ice for people like me that run hot. The sleeves have silicone patches on the elbows and additional sleeves that fold over your elbow pads similar to the Shock Doctor I mentioned above. In addition, they have a cut resistant forearm protection which is a nice feature. Downside is the cost. Full retail is $140 and that's a tough pill to swallow. They have done sales up to 40% off which I feel brings them down to a more reasonable price. Even at a discounted price of $80, these are overpriced, but they are very nice. We'll see how well they hold up long term. 



https://warroad.com/collections/tilo/products/tilo-pro-padloc-cr-top-black





Last up is a basic top from Adidas that I'm still waiting to arrive. It doesn't have many frills other than silicone stripes on the elbows to help keep your pads in place. It's supposed to have mesh panels throughout and other adidas tops I've had made from these materials breathe well so I'm hopeful for this one. Can't comment anything beyond that, but the price is about $40 which puts it on the lower end of the spectrum. 


https://www.leagueoutfitters.com/products/adidas-mens-hockey-baselayer-longsleeve-shirt?variant=39593810034748





At the end of the day, it all comes down to what features you want out of your base layers and how much you're willing to pay. These comments are all about tops as I simply rotate between two pair of the TSLA bottoms. I know a lot of guys want built in velcro for socks or a pocket for cups, but I'm old school and use a cup/garter combo which can be used with anything",1,Reddit,adidas

I'm a dude. I've gotten into a whole bunch of nice Manhattan nightclubs (Cielo, Le Bain, Marquee, etc) while wearing colorful leggings and hi-top sneakers and a colorful t-shirt, or in a leopard-print catsuit with harness and boots (got me into Berghain), or any of several latex catsuits with a corset and harness and boots. Another fave outfit is an Adidas tracksuit with a cool print paired with colorful sneakers. I went to Output while wearing a rainbow dress one time. In a decade of partying basically every single weekend, I have been denied entry to a club just one time, in Manhattan, in 2015, which was because I was wearing a (very stylish) one-piece tank-top/capri outfit and I tried to get into swanky Hudson Terrace, which was understandable.  


Any decent club/party wants to curate an eclectic and festive crowd (see: Limelight, Studio 54).

RunningShoeGeeks,23/12/2021 09:58:47 AM,hpo0ikm,"So this is kind of a three part question

1. I'm looking to get my first actual pair of running shoes and run ~15-20 km a week mostly to stay in shape for soccer. For soccer I'm wearing cleats with a thin outsole. And I've always mostly done my running in Nike Frees (currently Free Flyknit 4.0) and never had any sort of knee pain. Worst thing I've had is minor shin splints, but rarely. I'd like more cushion than the Frees just for comfort, but I'm worried if I add too much it could increase my risk of injury with the contrast of thin cleats to thick runners. 

2. What determines how much cushion one needs in a shoe? Is it strictly a comfort decision? If I'm only going to be running ~20 km per week, would something with more cushion be wasted on the lower mileage? Like would it be dumb to buy Adidas Takumi Sen 8 despite that blue/pink colorway being incredibly hot.

3. Any shoe suggestions or recommendations for my particular issue? I initially had my eye on the Pegasus 38, but kind of want to look in a different direction after finding out they're quite heavy compared to other trainers at a similar price point.",1,Reddit,adidas

Sneakers,23/12/2021 07:21:40 AM,hpnor1f,You‚Äôre welcome. Yeezy supply is legit. It‚Äôs basically the only place where hyped yeezy‚Äôs release for retail. It‚Äôs similar to how Nike has the Nike app and the SNKRS app. SNKRS app being for more hyped releases. Also on yeezy supply when things release it‚Äôll most likely be in the morning and shoes can sell out in just minutes so its best to be ready and on time. You can also try raffles on the adidas confirmed app.,1,Reddit,adidas

pennystocks,23/12/2021 07:16:57 AM,hpnocvs,"This stock is incredibly special. In fact, it's an unprecedented opportunity that I've never come across before.


Their patented, proprietary and revolutionary products were going to disrupt the apparel industry like how Lululemon has imo. To beat Nike, Adidas and Puma out of contracts and gather 6 known football clubs within 12 months is nothing short of profound. Particularily having their kits being used and seen by millions of people all over the world watching the Premier League. 


(If Dryworld had the clubs they had back then today, their share price would be anywhere from $20 to $50 today)


They were on a super fast track in scaling their brand awareness on a global scale like Under Armour at one point, generating hundreds of millions in dollars if not billion. But a defaulted loan from their financiers neglected to contractually loan the needed amount for production. The finance company, TCA, got sued by the SEC and was forced to liquidate all of their $400 million in assets. They went belly up needless to say, but Dryworld continued for another year and eventually reastablished their presence in China a couple years later. 


And now, they're back, and the story to redemption begins. Enter Dryworld 2.0 ladies and gentlemen. They've never been more connected and established in the industry than ever, so don't be surprised to see big and unprecedented deals that are realistically plausible and can legitimately happen.",1,Reddit,adidas

There are yeezys for under 350 in some sizes on resell markets if you are really wanting to get him those. More reputable are Stockx, GOAT, and ebay (with authenticity guarantee only, some shoes have this on ebay is noted on the listing). Those three have a middle man who handles payment and legit checking. 

As for model, I am speaking for the crowd here, dunks are still the hype sorta. Lots of pairs circulating, not tooo expensive depending on colourway. Some Air jordans, specifically the 1s, 3s, 4s, 11s are quite popular with varying levels of prices. Sticking with some basketball models, lebrons (any model tbh), kyries, pgs are all good models and can find them at footlockers for the most part. Adidas yeezy 500, 700, 350s, hell, foam runners even if you want to surprise him. Given, besides the basketball models, the rest are gonna have to be from a reselling website.

I own both however I see very large differences in both subs. This sub likes to over estimate things grossly. Before the ER this sub was predicting over 55% of the shares had been DRS‚Äôd based off of averages they took from popcorn (cause AA is the only ceo of the two who has stated the retail ownership/average shares). But then the ER came out at only 5million we‚Äôre DRS‚Äôd. when DRS was first being ‚Äúreally‚Äù pushed this sub was posting darkpool % as proof that DRS was working‚Ä¶which a week later % skyrocketed again‚Ä¶not even going to talk about the LRC connection that isn‚Äôt even talked about now as LRC has moved on from GME to Adidas now.

Again, I am in both as they are 100% without a doubt being manipulated by the same group of people, one is not a distraction to the other and both help each other out equally.

FootFunction,23/12/2021 02:06:23 AM,hpmv2vn,"I've had custom orthotics since September to treat what was originally diagnosed as metatarsalgia but I've since learned is a plantar plate sprain. The met pad was initially too far back to actually offload pressure on the forefoot, and they also added a millimetre or two of heel-toe drop which seemed to make things worse. 

In October my new podiatrist changed the met dome to a bar-shaped pad and moved it up and this made a huge difference. She also took out the heel to toe drop. 

A game-changer for my recovery  was her recommendation to get a runner with a carbon plate and rocker (I bought adidas boston 10s but I've heard the Hoka's are good). I think it would be tough to heal this injury without these shoes. The combination of orthotics and these shoes have  protected my toe joints and allowed me to calm the pain down- which has been key for me to be able to start strengthening the area. If you have this injury and are on a limited budget the I think the shoes are more important than the orthotics. 

I'm still using the shoes and orthotics for most walking outdoors but am already experimenting to see how much I can walk without them before triggering pain. Before I found this sub I found this article quite helpful (for plantar plate injuries) : [https://www.running-physio.com/plantar-plate3/](https://www.running-physio.com/plantar-plate3/) .

Unless the words out of your mouth was along the lines of ""This Adidas hoodie looks like shit I don't understand why you'd get me this"", I don't see how you would've rudely told him you don't like the gift.   
Sometimes it sucks when you get someone a gift and they don't like it, but the man did the bare minimum and got you a sweater and a teddy bear. Gift receipts are a thing and most people who have common sense know that there's always a chance that the clothing isn't something the person likes or might not fit them and exchanges might be made.

I got a gift from my boyfriend and he asked if I liked it. I initially said yes but later tried to explain that I appreciated thought but it's not my usual style (it was an Adidas hoodie)  I explained that I had one like it that I don't wear because it doesn't go with my type of clothing. My intention wasn't to be rude because even though it was from a charity shop he still spent money on me, I just wanted to be honest so he'd have better idea of the types of things I like. I must have phrased it badly because he got really mad and called me rude and told me he didn't want any of the gifts I'd gotten him (he knew I'd spent alot of money and I can't return them and had also spent ages finding this I thought he'd like and making some things) He offered to give me my money back that I'd spent on his gifts. He told me I can throw the hoodie out and that he doesn't care. I feel really bad but I can't change the fact that I've said it. I thought I was doing the right thing because I personally would have wanted to know the truth. He's really mad and thinks I'm ungrateful and unappreciative even though I've loved the other gift (a teddy) that he gave me. I don't know what to do

trumpet,22/12/2021 09:50:08 PM,hplxfla,"I love my Monette piece. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone. Well, almost anyone. I wouldn't recommend it to an absolute beginner. The reason being that a mouthpiece is very much a style.  Think of it like shoes.

Church's English shoes are great for formal wear.  DMs are also great. As are Converse, Nike, Adidas etc. All great shoes. Sure, your $5 trainers down the market are pretty much guaranteed to be crap and will leak within 5 minutes, but a good pair of shoes is a good pair of shoes, right?

Yeah, if all you want is something to cover your feet.  But often people are looking for a specific something, and sizing can be different between different brands.  And if you're growing, buying a $500 pair of Nike trainers isn't a great idea for value.

My point is, at some point he will know why he wants to change mouthpiece, and what he wants out of a new piece, and will be able to test them to see what works for him.  That point is not today, and won't be for a good few years.",1,Reddit,adidas

Sneakers,22/12/2021 09:29:02 PM,hplucab,"This is not true. The sneaker companies are the problem. They create demand and hype with collaborations and low stock. You cannot blame the ones that make use of the market forces. That‚Äôs not something special for the sneaker community.

Also the amount of producing the shoes is irrelevant. I mean, for how much money some baseball cards or Pok√©mon cards are being traded and how much do you think it cost the manufacturer to produce those cards? Way less than a shoe. They make some cards rare to create demand and hype. That‚Äôs the problem. 

Only sneaker companies are able to kill the resell. Adidas is doing so with some Yeezy‚Äôs by re-releasing some sneakers with the same code, so all resellers loose their profits on their holds (last years 350 V2 Breds for example).

Another creative example is the release of the New Balance 650 collaboration with ALD. Last summer you could purchase those shoes in advance. However, you‚Äôve to wait for Feb/Mar next year to get them.",1,Reddit,adidas
goodyearwelt,22/12/2021 09:28:30 PM,hplu9j2,"Was searching for a Canadian-made boot that I liked the style of (was looking for this style of 'not-Timberland'/workboot). They are actually very comfortable right out of the box (just wearing them around the house right now to 'break in'). I got the black, and they are beautiful. Will consider the brown, but I'm leaning towards a pair of the brownish/tan 'Romeo' Chelseas for a casual pull-on style (to replace my 10-yr-old Blundstones).   


Have to say, these boots are very well constructed. The stitching in clean and sturdy. The Vibram soles are great. I was thinking of inserting some new Blundstone inserts (that I happened to have lying around), but decided against if for now. It's winter, and I'm wearing thicker socks, so the cushioning is there.   


The boots I bought (from Reddhart in Burnaby) fit me very well, but they are a full size smaller than the boots I normally wear. I normally wear a size 8 men's Adidas (for reference), a 7 in the Blundstones, and these boots are a 6.5. So, half size smaller than what I wear in the Blundstone boots (which fit snug, due to their slip-on style). Something to keep in mind if you are ordering these online. I think it's due to the large and high toe-box on these. I'll have more on this later.  


I'll probably post a YouTube review at some point over the Holiday Season.",1,Reddit,adidas

NFT,22/12/2021 09:24:55 PM,hpltqko,"An NFT is a certificate of authenticity, nothing more. Nothing stops you from creating a fake one just like nothing stops people from making fake tags for shoes or handbags. 

The safety comes into play when a person buys an item. If they don't care about whether something is authentic or not, nothing you do will change what that person buys. Having said that, most people want to buy the original from the actual creator. Those people will verify if the certificate of authenticity is real or not. This is easy: Say I want to buy an Adidas NFT. I find one I like, so I'm going to take like 5 seconds to verify that it was minted by the Adidas wallet. 

Fake NFT's take advantage of people who either don't care, or don't take a second to verify.

The top trainers we‚Äôre undoubtably Nike, reebok, adidas, puma and British knights. No. 1 would vary, Nike when they released air Jordan. Reebok top with originals and pumps, adidas gazelle, puma states etc they would swap top place depending on latest releases

Second tier was hi tech. You could buy these at the same sports shop as top tier but they were cheaper and from memory the most common at school. I never liked them personally 

Third tier was the trainers you could buy in the cheap shoe shop. These were Dunlop, Gola and Zephyr. I only know 1 kid who wore Zephyr but I bet for geek chic these would be the ultimate now and cost a lot. I googled and couldn‚Äôt find any

NFT,22/12/2021 04:40:38 PM,hpknm5d,"Keep it simple. An NFT is a certificate of authenticity, nothing more. 

You don‚Äôt have to understand the underlying systems to understand and use the product. If you have the COA for an item, it has value. If you don‚Äôt have the certificate of authenticity for an item that should have one, it has less, or no, value. If someone other than the real creator makes a COA, we know it‚Äôs fake because it didn‚Äôt come from the creator of the item. 

Until now, we‚Äôve had to rely on holograms and serial numbers and idk what else in attempts to make it hard for people to make counterfeit certificates of authenticity. All NFTs show what wallet address created the NFT. If the address isn‚Äôt the address of the creator, you know it‚Äôs fake. No one can make an NFT with someone else‚Äôs wallet address. For example: I want to buy an Adidas NFT. I can easily see what the Adidas authorized wallet address is by going to their site. If I go to buy an Adidas NFT, I‚Äôm going to take a couple seconds to make sure the address that created the one I want to buy matches the address Adidas owns. If it is any address other than what Adidas has on their site, I know it‚Äôs fake. The only people who can make an NFT from the Adidas wallet is Adidas.

NFTs are the next evolution of the COA. That‚Äôs why they work exceptionally well for ticketing. It‚Äôs insanely easy for a ticket booth to simply verify that they created the NFT that a person has in their wallet at an event by verifying the wallet address that created the NFT. What systems the event uses to check and verify is irrelevant and confusing. It‚Äôs like trying to examine what systems and processes created the gas you use in your car. You‚Äôre likely to just get confused unless you‚Äôre a petroleum engineer. That doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt able to use and enjoy your car though.",1,Reddit,adidas

CFB,22/12/2021 04:27:31 PM,hpklnx5,"&gt;so Auburn certainly paid more

My tin foil hat theory: UnderArmour was the one paying Cam at Auburn.

So we all know about how Adidas was paying recruits and players in CBB, right? That almost certainly means that Adidas and their competitors are doing the same in CFB. Notice that UA signed a major contract with Cam immediately after he left Auburn. 

I reffed youth football back in the day, and at Cam's height 2014-2018 or so, half the kids playing youth football that I officiated wore his CN UnderArmour cleats. Those high-tops were probably the most popular single brand of cleats I saw on the field at the youth level.

I also find a very fun coincidence that Mississippi State signed their initial contract with Adidas in 2009, right when Cecil Newton was shopping Cam out to various schools.

I think the NCAA knows that the shoe/apparel companies have been paying players to go to their contracted schools for some time, and that's why they're likely to not punish the schools involved in the FBI/fed case that Adidas got caught up in. Even though there's taped and under-oath evidence of the Adidas employees paying players out in the public.",1,Reddit,adidas

I'm neutral and these worked for me:

1. High cushioning, but heavier than most running shoes: ASICS. Good for training, long runs, long walks, but may not be the best when you're trying to be as light as possible. Pag pagod na legs Mo, mabigat. :) Pag sale Sa runnr you can get these around 5k, but the new ones usually 8-9k. Lasted me two years with training. I can see the wear and tear talaga Sa heel so I'm happy I got this when I was starting. 


2. Adidas Ultraboost 2019/20. I don't have 22 yet so I can't tell. It's lighter than ASICS, has cushioning, and has a slightly wider toe box for me. I have a slight bunion (ugh) and thankfully it doesn't hurt or chafe with UB. Still use my ub2019 for skipping, 20 for longer walks / runs kahit pudpod na.


3. If you want lighter running shoes with additional springy push, consider carbonX by Hoka. It's my 2021 shoes for speed runs. Ang gripe ko Lang is, it feels tighter around my toes so I need to size up by half.

latterdaysaints,22/12/2021 03:01:15 PM,hpk9gth,"&gt;Bishops get contacted about many things that they do not need to deal with. Many 'emergencies' are not truly emergencies. 

We had this discussion recently on this sub. I wish every member would be required to read and understand your comments and then learn to apply them. People need to stop contacting the bishop because they are unsure whether to purchase Nikes or Adidas. Silly example, I know, but I worked with a bishop who had to respond to members who continually asked for advice on trivial matters or had to deal with problems that should properly have been handled by the heads of other organizations.

&gt;Elders quorum presidencies and relief society presidencies should be the first stop for dealing with many issues affecting adults in the ward or branch. The bishop is primarily responsible for the youth. If someone is an adult and having some sort of 'emergency', that person should contact the elders quorum president or relief society president before contacting the bishop. This is a relatively recent refocus for bishops but it is current church policy.

A member of the Q12 recently gave a multi-stake training on this very topic, explaining that issues of homelessness, joblessness, marital strife, and other serious problems should be handled in the first instance by the EQ and RS presidents. He  role modeled specific examples of people approaching a bishop with these (and other) serious concerns, explaining that the bishop should delegate most problems to EQ and RS leadership while he maintains his focus on the youth. We need a church-wide overhaul in how we think about the role of a bishop and adjust our expectations and demands accordingly.",1,Reddit,adidas

A great vegan/cruelty free/eco friendly brand very close to my heart is Matt &amp; Nat.

Romania,22/12/2021 02:28:35 PM,hpk566t,"&gt; lol 'deocamdata'? Mai treci un pic prin istoria lingvistica a Romaniei un pic.

Adica vorbim de prezent, nu ne referim la istoric, cand am trecut la alfabetul latin, cand am adotat cuvinte din franceza, cand am schimbat forma cuvintelor etc. De cand am facut scoala si pana acum a trecut mult timp iar  academia a schimbat doar √Æ in √¢, iar mai tarziu a facut niste schimbari de cuvinte (nicio, niciun, niciunul, odata ce, odata cu, si alte cateva schimbari). In rest a introdus o gramada de cuvinte noi in doom (adidas, banner, link, hacker, finess, doar sa numesc cateva). Cam in asta a constat evolutia limbii romane in ultimul timp, intr-un imprumut masiv de cuvinte.

In a doua parte, nu faci distinctia intre cei care aleg sa vorbeasca asa dar stiu sa vorbeasca si  in mod formal, cum am facut-o mai sus. De asta am dat ca exemplu pe cei care in continuare folosesc unele cuvinte in mod neironic (ghiuveta, succesuri etc). La fel cum unii aleg cel mai mic numitor comun, de cele mai multe ori din lene, tot din acelasi motiv ajung multi sa nu cunoasca limba romana in totalitate, ci doar pe cea de sat/cartier, mai ales acum ca educatia este in continua panda descendenta. 

A aparut un nou fenomen, cel in care tinerii nu prea inteleg ce spun batranii din diferite regiuni ale tarii. Aici nu se refera doar la accent dar in mare parte la vocabularul folosit, fiind cuvinte care asa incetisor devin arhaisme. Tinerii folosesc un limbaj redus la un numitor comun, ceea ce nu e neaparat rau, dar folosesc si foarte multe englezisme, in derimentul cuvintelor romanesti. Alte cuvinte vechi mai sunt folosite dar cu sens schimbat. Bunicii spuneau slobozit in sensul de a pune in libertate (este sinonim cu libertate), de exemplu de a da drumul animalelor din sura/cotet, iar in ziua de azi are alt sens. In fine, am deviat, dar daca acesti tineri nu pot comunica cu acesti batrani, atunci nu este chiar o problema? Sa comunici cu un prieten nu este singurul scop, poate lucrezi ca orice altceva, medic de exemplu, si ai fost detasat temporar in regiunea Maramures sau Moldova, si n-ar trebui sa ai nevoie de translator daca in timpul scolii citeai de exemplu Creanga. Oricum, cred ca ai pus problema gresit. Nu e vorba de a fi prost, faptul ca nu cunosti atatea limbi de pe pamant nu te face prost. Daca tinerii si batranii s-ar intelege in engleza, iar n-as vedea problema, dar daca aleg limba romana si cam schioapata comunicarea, atunci undeva este o involutie si nu o evolutie.",1,Reddit,adidas

Gunners,22/12/2021 01:59:17 PM,hpk1kt3,"&gt;Yeah but just because it‚Äôs not doing well doesn‚Äôt mean that some iteration of the same idea will eventually work.

Maybe, but things failing is also a pretty decent indication that they‚Äôll be shelved. 

&gt;NFTs can be far more than collectibles. There‚Äôs a lot more NFTs as keys than NFTs as collectibles.

Sure, but the examples of Nike, Adidas and McD‚Äôs you used were of NFT collectibles. If they also issue NFT voucher codes, that‚Äôs not exactly a new concept, it‚Äôs just a new way to track redemptions. What would he new is the was rewards are earned via indirect social currency. We aren‚Äôt there yet, we‚Äôve never really been there. 

&gt;The value of NFTs is often the ecosystem it allows you to access as opposed to single redemption or static objects.

Right, much like any virtual currency, the ecosystem needs to be brand safe and add value. The idea of sporting brands paying to launch reward infrastructures on networks like reddit is basically none of those things. 

&gt;In the future your season pass will be an NFT. Your season pass might give you a certain amount of arsenal coin per year which you can use buy stuff at the stadium or something. 

The rewards platform already does this (unsuccessfully). And it‚Äôs called a season ticket. Are you actually an arsenal fan or have you just come here to shill crypto?

&gt;I mean that stuff is pretty obvious right - your ticket to the game is an NFT, if you want to sell it you will do so on an exchange and the authencity will be verified as legitimate by the hash.

Ticket transfer already exists. Membership already exists. I actually see this a lot when people shill NFTs. It‚Äôs not a new process, it‚Äôs just a new protocol that powers an existing process. The consumer experience won‚Äôt change at all.",1,Reddit,adidas

Also keep in mind that the NF270 is a 4u (80-84g) racket whereas the Carbonex is probably an overall heavier 3u racket and the difference in weight plays a big role when it comes to smashing power

Why not check out the Duora series from Yonex? Most of these rackets are even balanced and offer options in 3u or 4u.

The Astrox range offers some slightly head heavy rackets both in 3u and 4u as well.

You basically need to remodel your store each time you go for a new product, same domain, same name, same settings &amp; same policies ( maybe few minor changes )

trackandfield,22/12/2021 06:44:30 AM,hpj1o3p,"Hi - fellow distance runner here, used to heel strike more than I do (worth working on it does help with injuries and efficiency) but in the meantime heres a few ideas.
If you‚Äôre looking for cushioning in the heel of a spike, I would recommend taking a look at the Hoka rocket LDs or the Hoka Evo R spikes, those would both be reasonably cushioned distance spikes. Another option might be the Nike matumbo?
Another route you could go on this would be to try the new super spikes, as those are often cushier in general and also wicked fast, and with the carbon/Pebax plates they might even help you get more used to the feeling of a mid foot strike. The Nike dragonflies have become a staple in college racing (great spike), but the adidas ones are easier to find and are sometimes cheaper. Currently Adidas has the Adizero ambition (800-5k, they say up to 1500 but we‚Äôve seen NAU guys wear these up to 5k) are on sale for like $72 I think?

But as always with shoes, your best bet is to go somewhere and try some on, and pick the ones that feel best. I know that can be difficult especially during Covid, but when you‚Äôre area gets a safer time I would try to go to a store somewhere and try on some different options. I used to heelstrike a lot and I ended up choosing a super minimal distance spike that served me well for years, so go figure.

Hope this helps!",1,Reddit,adidas

Don't spend too much on them because your goal should be to outgrow them. Heel striking is a symptom of poor running posture,  underdeveloped leg strength, and a lack of stamina.   Hill repeats help tremendously because they encourage a forward lean. Be sure not to lean back on the recovery downhills though.  I was definitely a heel striker starting out. I ran in basic Nike long distance spikes. Built up my leg and core strength and transitioned into a mid-foot striker in about 18 months.  Senior year I was running the 1600 in heal-less adidas sprinters spikes. You will never run fast as a heel striker. It is incredibly inefficient.",1,Reddit,adidas

Nfts are something that can be difficult to understand and takes decoupling from the Jpegs selling for $500 million. It is an exchange of a good or product with each having a unique unchangeable or recreatable identity which is a core feature of many things today. For example each mortgage has a unique identifier for the sale of a house. The state files that under ownership and uses it to verify purchases. Many of these transactions are done via paper, are not easily accessible, or are in a centralized database. Nfts make these Public and allow for secure exchange that prevents any forgeries. Another example of nfts is in shoes. Adidas recently bought ja rules company that incorporates nfts into shoes. The sneaker game is with billions and shoes can cost $20,000 a pair so there is a huge problem with knock offs from China. If I want to sell you these shoes I bought from adidas how do you know they aren‚Äôt fake? By putting a unique code on the shoe linking the transaction to my ownership of the nft given with the shoe we can now know it‚Äôs real without any need for trust, a relationship, or a third party. When I sell you the shoe I transfer nft ownership just like any other contract of goods and now it is publicly verifiable you own a real pair of these shoes.

Hey all, picked up the adidas lexicon advs and i love them, i love how the look and how they feel when initially putting them on. But unfortunately that's where it stops lol. I found through my searches that there has been reviews where people report discomfort on the top of their foot and I seem to be experiencing the same. It's where the tongue is stitched to boot and it applies enough pressure to create numbness after wearing them indoors for about 20 -25 mins mostly sitting and a little bit of on my feet/taking a few steps. 

I've tried to mess with the lacing a lot to loosen up over the lowest laces but still experience the issue after a bit of wearing. 

I have two questions. 1) did someone tough it out and experience this part soften up? 

2) I was thinking of swapping for the response 3mc as i really like the feel of Adidas boots overall compared to ride lasso, k2 maysis, and i think i tried on salamon dialogue iirc. Has anyone experienced the same top of the foot issue with the response? I do have a borderline wide foot, width D on E, 28.5 cm.

 Also found Adidas sizing strange, everywhere online says size down by a 1/2 size except Adidas themselves! I typically wear 10.5 boots ( 28.5 cm) and their website says I'd be a 11.5-12 which is roughly my usual street shoe size (d width).

I recommend you have a look at 'knox urbane pro'. It's a fully protective motorbike shirt. You can layer your Adidas jackets and jumpers over it (I've never had to size up) and look sick af. It's very cool in the summer and a puffer vest plus waterproof jacket has been keeping me warm this time of year. It squeezes into my locker at college well too!

A pair of armoured jeans is the first trouser anyone should look at. Casual, protective, comfortable. Packable overtrousers keep you dry in rain.

I wouldn't recommend spending mental money on your first helmets. Go for reputable brands budget helmets (¬£90-150 HJC, Bell, Scorpion...)

Alla kan sk√§rmdumpa din apa eller den f√∂rsta tweeten men du √§ger r√§ttigheten att s√§lja den vidare, hyra ut den eller sk√§nka bort den.

Stronglifts5x5,21/12/2021 09:27:22 PM,hph42uh,"A hunch, but by looking at your ankle range of motion, but I wonder if it could stem from ankle flexibility. Have you ever done an ankle dorsiflexion stretch test to see how flexible your ankles are?

I raise it as an inflexibility in one joint (ankle, knee, hip) can sometimes manifest itself in pain or discomfort in another. This is because your body wants to hinge through the immobile joint, but can't so has to compensate by hinging with a different pattern through the remaining joints.

If this is a possible cause then you could try working on that flexibility with stretches, or try squatting in a shoe that has a heel, I use the Adidas Leistung powerlifting shoes personally.

Having a heeled shoe opens up the angle angle meaning you don't need as acute of an angle to hit depth.

It may not help, but could be worth a try.

Other things you could try are switching between low and high bar. Sometimes one works better than the other for your own personal moment arms. 

If you find that the pain isnt related so much to a breakdown in form, and something else is going on, then you may also want to try lifting wearing knee sleeves. This is the norm in powerlifting anyway and may help with your confidence in the hole if being concious of the pain is limiting psychologically.",1,Reddit,adidas

I work for adidas and have for a couple years, and my collection has gotten way bigger than I‚Äôd like. Here I‚Äôm hoping to pass off some of my well loved shoes to you for a good price! I can‚Äôt sell anything adidas above retail price, and I‚Äôm only posting this once, so DM me on anything you‚Äôd be interested in. All pricing is based off of what I think is fair and the value I think each sneaker still has :)

RedWingShoes,21/12/2021 09:17:58 PM,hph2oxe,"These are stiff but extremely comfortable shoes when broken in. I will say, breaking them in feels like walking on a couple pieces of 2x4s when you first get them but slowly over time the insole molds exactly to your feet. I even have a picture of the insides of the shoes and I can see each one of my toes imprinted in the insole. As well, the leather is tough at first but also slowly wraps around your feet. These boots and my iron rangers are my most comfortable boots, even though they‚Äôre still stiff. If you were nikes or adidas they feel super soft and comfortable kinda like a mattress. However I‚Äôve noticed after a full day of work or walking my feet really ache. While my redwings aren‚Äôt super soft like my air forces or similar shoes, I‚Äôve noticed my feet don‚Äôt hurt nearly as bad as when I wear the more ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù nikes. I can walk in them all day and feel perfectly fine afterwards. So yes they‚Äôre a little stiffer and tougher to walk on, but they are more comfortable than any other shoe I‚Äôve worn by far.

BravoRealHousewives,21/12/2021 08:37:00 PM,hpgwlvs,"I think as a rule of thumb, people only apply accents to other peoples actual names, and usually only if asked, and its a pretty American thing to even do that... 

like when I lived in Italy no one would say my name American. they would pronounce in the Italian way. Same with France, they always said it the French way. In the US since we're a nation of immigrants its way more common for people to respect other's preferred pronunciations, and learn them. 

I don't really think this extends to international brands though. Like Starbucks, Mcdonalds, Nike-- they are pronounced differently outside the US. And within the US, there are a million day to day brands that we don't accent properly. 

In Sweden, Ikea is ""eh-key-ah"". In germany Porsche has two syllables ""por-sha,"" and BMW is ""bee-em-vee"". Adidas is also a good one -- in europe is ""ADDY-das"" whereas in the US is ""AH dee das""

If you speak french its fine you say french brands and words in your french tongue of course, but its just generally not expected that you would also say german words german and italian words italian. that would be nuts and we'd all be subjected to a lot of bad accents.",1,Reddit,adidas

My dad picked me up from the house to go look at cars yesterday and my mom was very upset with the outfit I walked outside the house in: a Nike hoodie and adidas sweatpants. I no it‚Äôs a faux pas to cross brand, but a) my other hoodies were in my twin brothers room where he was taking a final exam and b) I was barely going to get out of my dads car, so I determined it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. 


Today, my mom starts insulting my clothes. She says my clothes look bad and that what I wore yesterday was unacceptable. I tried to explain why I didn‚Äôt dress super nice and she would not take it. She then says that my fashion is why I can‚Äôt get a girlfriend and why people always tell me I act ‚Äúwhite.‚Äù My mom knows that I‚Äôm very self conscious about these things so I was upset. Tbf I don‚Äôt know if she actually believes that but my mom is someone who will say anything to hurt your feelings if she gets upset. 

I go to a service academy, so iI am in uniform 90% of the time and I can‚Äôt just leave whenever I want to buy new clothes. Since I‚Äôm home for Christmas break, I was planning to buy new clothes without her, which she was offended by. I told her that I don‚Äôt take her fashion advice because it is ‚Äúdated‚Äù and she will have me looking crazy. She freaks out and says how she would never have talked to her mom that way and how she would always take her fashion advice. I told my mom that her logic was dumb and emotional and she starts talking about how she messed up raising me. My sister comes to my moms rescue to tell me how I‚Äôm a bad son and all that. 


What I don‚Äôt get is that I will always go to my mom for advice, but for fashion, I just feel that my 50-something year old mother isn‚Äôt really the person to go to. I told her she had dumb logic, but that‚Äôs only after her using my blackness, lack of a girlfriend, and deceased grandmother to make me feel like I‚Äôm a bad person. I also have been on the deans list every semester of college and am an A student, so I don‚Äôt get why wearing a Nike hoodie with adidas sweatpants is something she‚Äôs freaking out over. But my sister and mom think I‚Äôm just a failure of a person, so maybe I am TA.

antiMLM,21/12/2021 06:54:46 PM,hpgh63l,"I can see the appeal. Better than my friends and family who always get bored and interrupt when I'm telling one of my long, rambling stories with multiple tangents but only occasionally a point.

Me: ""OMG God, so I have a story! Okay, so the other day I ran into this guy I met about six, seven years ago. I don't remember his name, but I know he was dating this woman named Gretchen, whom I remember because her name is uncommon and this guy I went to junior high with‚Äîhis name was Mike‚Äîwould joke that 'gretchen' sounds like the noise your shoe makes when you try to scrape dog shit off of it while walking. I almost told her that when I met her, but the part of my brain that isn't a complete dumbass told me that she probably wouldn't enjoy that joke. See? Sometimes I know how to human. Mike was a super nice guy: one of the 'bad' kids, but the principal sat me next to him because I was a nerd and they thought my grades would rub off on him. Idiots. Who sends the fat, nerdy, unpopular new kid to infiltrate the bad kids and set a good example? Do they not know how junior high works? Anyway, his grades didn't improve, but we became friends and that's how I ended up getting in shit for smoking pencil shavings rolled up in a Post-It¬Æ and my parents almost sent me to this all boys Catholic school, which just got shut down maybe a decade ago because all they'd do is beat the shit out of the kids. Thankfully my parents' devotion ended where their wallets were concerned so they weren't willing to shell out the tuition. Ugh. So, where was I going? Right, Gretchen. Oh, and Mike went on to become a paramedic, so he ended up alright. Big car guy. Was an amateur race car driver for a bit. Anyway, Gretchen's dad was a sales rep for a tool company‚ÄîI wanna say Hilti? I think it was Hilti‚Äîand he had an atrophied arm because he had polio when he was young. So, uh, shit‚ÄîI was going somewhere with this. What was I talking about before Gretchen? Oh, right: her boyfriend. Anyway, I saw him the other day, and he was wearing the shoes I just saw on that commercial. I thought they were the weirdest-looking things, but also kind of cool, and I thought maybe they were custom one-offs, since he was the type of guy to wear custom footwear‚Äînot pretentious; just someone who puts effort into having a unique look but it's just a part of who they are and how they like to look and they're not trying to impress anyone or show off‚Äîbut then I find out those shoes are just the latest trend. All the kids have them. Have you seen them? They're not bad, as far as weird shoe trends go. Did you know Adidas and Puma were founded as rival companies by two brothers who started a shoe company together but then had a falling out?""

God: ...

Me *\[nodding\]*: You know what I never got until just recently? Mountains. Hated them. Couldn't understand the appeal. When I was in university my girlfriend would drag me out camping in the mountains, and I'd always be like ""why the fuck would I want to drive for four hours to sleep next to a glacier in July? This is Canada. Wait six months and we'll be shoveling glaciers off our front sidewalks."" So, we'd go, and I'd be pissy all weekend. Man, I was such a dink then. But still, why couldn't I just stay home while she went camping with her friends? So many red flags in that relationship.

But then I had a manager who would occasionally work on health projects in Pakistan, and she showed some slides from a recent trip and holy shit, they have beautiful green mountains there! I had no idea. Those mountains are pretty. The Rockies, on the other hand, can take their snowy, jagged bullshitry and go fuck themselves...""",1,Reddit,adidas

Basically the exact same situation in our household: I work mostly from home, and I like to do the same thing -- sort of wake up slowly, usually by spending 30 minutes sitting on the toilet doing mindless stuff like watching YouTube videos, checking Facebook or whatever. But I do it in our second bathroom, because my wife would justifiably kill me if I occupied our master bathroom while she was trying to get ready for work. (For what it's worth, we don't have kids yet. I fully realize I won't be able to do this if/when we have kids!) I had the same complaint about it being cold in the rest of the apartment in the morning. Know how I fixed it? A rug in the bathroom and a cheap pair of Adidas slides that I leave by the bed at night. Combined, those two things were like $26 on Amazon.

If nobody is changing their routine -- e.g. one of you starts going to the gym in the morning, or one of you has a change in your work schedule and starts the day earlier or later -- there's only one viable solution here, and it's for your husband to suck it up and use the second bathroom.",1,Reddit,adidas

onebag,21/12/2021 04:16:59 PM,hpft61p,"Veteran of several RTW backpacking trips here. You're bringing too much shit. It's a textbook mistake, that it took me until my third try to get right (going smaller each time).

My advice:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Jackets (stuffed into water bottle pouches): Packable down jacket Packable rain jacket

Seems OK so far.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Upper: Merino t shirts - 3 Polos - 2 LS base layer - 1 LS button down - 2 Tank top - 1 Sweater - 1

Waay too many shirts. 4 x T-shirts, 1 x Tank top. 1 Hoodie/ flight fleece. If you're hitting up SEA or central and south America, a button up short sleeve Hawaiian shirt (for men) is a good option as well.

Fuck off the merino. It'll get trashed in hostels and local laundry places. Just take poly (Under armor make some good ones) or cotton T's, and swap them out as you go.

Plenty cheaper.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Lower: Pants - 3 Normal shorts -2 Swim trunks - 1 Socks - 5 Underwear - 5  


Waaaaaay too many. Way way too many.

Maximum - 2 shorts (total) that you can **ALSO** swim in, 2 pants (one casual, one that you can hike in).

Better yet, limit yourself to 1 x pair of convertible hiking pants, 1 x pair of shorts (that can be swam in) and 1 pair of casual pants or jeans.

I suggest Outlier New Way 5's for the shorts. Can be dressed up or down, and can be swam in.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Footwear: Flip flops Trail runners Casual walking shoes

Go with 1 pair flip flops, and 1 pair of shoes that are **ALSO** comfy to hike in (combine the trail runners and the casual walking shoes).

Adidas Terrex Boosts are a great option here. Heck, ANY boost shoes by Adidas work here.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Electronics: Chargers Laptop Kindle iPhone

You're not going to like this, but ditch the laptop unless you 110 percent **NEED** it for work or vlogging.

You're not travelling the world to be glued to your laptop (get your ass down to the Hostel bar and meet people FFS), you can do everything you need on your phone. Your laptop is something heavy, expensive and fragile that will become an anchor the instant you walk out the door with it (freaking out about getting it stolen, or breaking it).

I promise you, ditch the laptop. They're the most regretted thing people bring and immediately wish they left behind, along with hiking boots.

Do bring a charging brick for your phone though. They come in super handy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Accessories: Water bottle Headlamp Scrubba portable washer Eye mask Toiletries Multiple credit cards Sleep sack Passport + vax certificate

Portable washer? Wut?

Bring a TSA travel lock for hostel lockers, and a deck of cards instead. A smaller packable or lay flat daypack will also come in handy. 

Thank me later.

&amp;#x200B;

RunningShoeGeeks,21/12/2021 02:37:49 PM,hpffgjs,"Supination is caused by the a foot being rigid (not flexible), and your arch not flexing properly. This isn't really something any shoe features are made to accommodate for. The big thing is that you will require more cushion in shoes to absorb the shock which your arch is not absorbing.

The downside to having to rely on the shoe's cushioning to make up for biomechanical problems is that it will put more load into the shoes and cause them to wear prematurely. Outside of replacing your shoes when you start noticing those pains pop up that aren't normally there, there isn't much advice to give. Sorry to say it, but wearing shoes out faster than others is just part of having a rigid foot.

You can definitely try out some other shoes to see if something hits a good balance though. Maybe try some with a higher durometer (firmer)? To throw out a couple to try, maybe take a look of the Hoka Carbon X2 (firmer than most Hoka, but still well cushioned), Adidas Boston 10, and the Saucony Endorphin Pro 2?",1,Reddit,adidas

RunningShoeGeeks,21/12/2021 01:53:12 PM,hpf9y6w,"Shoes arrived today from eBay. Was very excited to try this shoe as I usually run in cushy shoes, and have never tried anything ""racing flat"" style. Also my first Adidas shoe. Got them new, but pretty cheap (142.50AUD \~100USD). Ordering online is a bit risky for me because I have wide feet, my TTS is 8.5 2E, and I ordered the shoe online size 9. Went for a quick 4km endeavor, trying out different paces to see what I liked. Happy with the fit of the upper, the tongue is excellent. The heel lockdown isn't great for my foot, so I had to use a pretty tight lock-lace, which worked out fine for me. The shoes feel like they mould to your foot shape and they wrap nicely because of the amazing laces. The outsole is firm, when I first put them on they honestly felt like a $10 lifestyle shoe you would find at a dep store because the midsole was that firm. I found that once you start running in them though the midsole becomes really smooth and running 3:30/km feels super natural. It doesn't feel like a chore at all to accelerate from walking into 3min/km and just glide along. The outsole is also fabulous. I would say that the Sen 7's are definitely shoes meant for middle distance, I don't know if I could take them for a run longer than 5km. If not for the lack of cushion, it's the desire to run my 800m / mile pace at all times when these shoes are on my feet. Great shoes",1,Reddit,adidas

science,21/12/2021 09:38:48 AM,hpeo2xu,"Seems like every person in this thread went to school that required a uniform so let me give you some perspective on school with no uniform. I went to a large public American HS with a wide range of kids and a graduating class of 350. Kids at my school wouldn't definetely get picked on for some things but it was never clothing choice. Everyone on here is saying ""the rich kid with name brand"" but like that doesn't happen except for the few (like 1 or 2) ultra rich. You did not see even the popular kids wearing Gucci or other ultra high end designer brands. Idk if it's just my school but all kids in-between poor, med class, and rich all wore most of the same stuff. Poor and rich alike all wore Nike, Levi, Adidas, and many other popular brands. It wasn't like the poor were coming to school with holey shirts or something. 

I personally liked being able to wear what I want. Kids don't get to make a lot of decisions by themselves especially early on, but the one thing I always had was what clothes I wear. Sometimes I'd wake up and I'd just go to school in sweats. Sometimes I'd do polo and jeans. Sometimes I'd rep some school sports. Never ever in all my years of school did anyone ever make fun of what I wore. And I seriously dressed like a bum sometimes (I wore sweats a lot).

Clothing gives a kid a small way to express themselves and I think that's important early in life. Goth people could dress gothish, people who liked being comfy could wear sweats, people who liked dressing up could dress up, and anybody could dress however they want in-between as long as they didn't expose them damn shoulders. 

Anyway yeah growing up in school I couldn't have ever imagined having a uniform and I'm still glad being older I didn't have one growing up. Takes too much individuality out of a person.",1,Reddit,adidas

** Dora2168 Tue 21-Dec-21 07:44:37**

We recently had an early Christmas party with the family and the aunts and uncles gave out presents to the children. My sister and I had a discussion before the event and she said that she would prefer clothing for her two children, so I carefully set about shopping with care for the right products and size of clothing. On the day, my nephew was overjoyed when he opened his gifts and saw that he had received a new football kit, Adidas sports tracksuit and matching Adidas trainers
His sister had new luxury winter coat and cosy jumpers. Both children were delighted and overjoyed. My 8 year old then opened his gift, and I saw his face fall when he saw a bright neon yellow track top and joggers that were at least two sizes too big slide out of the gift wrap. I felt his disappointment, especially as I had taken the time to shop with care to give a useful gift. Should I return the items as it cannot fit my child or regift it? I don't think that I would let him wear a neon yellow tracksuit.
I later found the exact item online for ¬£10 on sale.",1,Reddit,adidas

As for durability, unless you wear heavy duty shoes like Timberland, mainstream brands like Adidas, Nike, NB, etc will last you about a year and a half at most if you regularly wear them. I suggest waiting for NB sales, get 2 pairs, and rotate them.

AustralianTeachers,21/12/2021 03:22:16 AM,hpdpbm8,"Thank you for that explanation. It's a lot different here, the best high school athletes get recruited to play at major colleges and universities for sports, then the best out of there are the ones who get selected to turn professional. It's different for a few sports, like baseball. You can get drafted by the pro league right out of high school, but if you choose to play baseball in college instead, you have to stay in college for at least 2 years before you can apply for the draft again. And pro teams also have various clauses in contracts that if you go right from high school, they end up paying your college tuition if you walk away from baseball. It's just crazy with high school sports. There's national media, websites dedicated to ranking high school players in various sports, recruiting services, and major sports brands like Nike and Adidas that sign contracts to outfit certain schools and districts because they are good at something. Then we have private and prep schools that just recruit athletes and compete nationally instead of at the state level. This is because most high school athletic organizations have a rule about not allowing recruiting. For example, there is a prep school nearby me that has different sports but they are basically a wrestling factory. Most of the teachers and staff there have some background in the sport and they compete at a national level. This past year they had 3 kids sign letters of intent to go to Division 1 colleges for wrestling. Next year it'll be more. 

Australia probably has different sports that get more attention like track, swimming, footy, soccer and others.",1,Reddit,adidas

It's been known since about September that he's going to be debuting Fear of God Athletics at Innersect in Shanghai, was supposed to be this week but got pushed back to the middle of January. Fear of God Athletics is not showing off anything without Jerry's explicit approval and endorsement, which means adidas isn't either.

In the presser when he joined, they said he was going to work on a Forum design for his first release. And it us called ""Premiere""ü§°

  


Also, in that same announcement they said the first shoe would be announcement by end of year with a 2022 product run. And it's about a year since they left Nike, could be a 12 month NDA ran out? I'm reading too much into it, but it's been a long time without news.

  


I expect FOG to ramp up on designs once they get the first batch released. It takes time to settle and know the process. I'm hyped about their future. Totally agree about Nike and what Jordan and doing to Jordan 1 releases. They are treading a fine line with over exposure. The Last Dance on Netflix really tilted the market and wiped kids memory of sneaker history.

If I want to easily trade Sand for adidas or GameStop token, I would need a rollup protocol to reduce gas fees. As Loopring can swap up to 16 tokens simultaneously it would make sense that Loopring would be the solution. If Sand is going to have an adidas or GameStop token inside their metaverse, they will want users to be able to purchase the other tokens using their Sand token. Gas fees would be too much. They would need a solution. For examle, if I have Sand and want GameStop. You have GameStop and want adidas and someone else has adidas and wants Sand. Loopring swaps them all at once. Up to 16 different erc-20 tokens at once. So if someone else has Atari (which has Substantial land inside sandbox and an erc-20 token)  or another erc token. Up to 16 of them. It can go even out of sandbox and swap them all. Reducing gas fees to all of the swaps involved, to a very low amount. This is the way. Makes sense to me. They need a solution either way.

Futurology,21/12/2021 12:42:47 AM,hpd4k3d,"&gt; I cant think of a single use for NFTs that is not scam idiots on buying an ape JPEG.

You're not thinking hard enough.  I almost want to frame this comment so we can come back to it in 5 years and laugh.

NFTs will be huge in the metaverse.  Your Avatar will wear Adidas NFTs.  Ticket sales will be done in NFTs.  Your favorite artists will release their songs as NFTs.  Every time a video game or piece of art is resold, the original content creator will get a percentage.

You will buy an NFT ticket to a concert and decide that you can't go anymore.  The ticket will be resold and the original seller will get a percentage of the resale.  They don't get those resale $ now, so obviously ticket sellers will jump on this tech.  If it's sold again, they will also get a cut of that resale.  No fake NFT tickets will ever be sold, because an NFT can be validated ahead of time via a smart contract and escrow.  Nearly anything with a digital component will have an NFT component.  You know how college textbooks have those activation codes that you have to use to access online content?  That will be an NFT.  If you resell a college book, they will get a cut when the NFT is transferred. 

You'll get an NFT with your happy meal and you'll load it in Fortnite for a special costume.  You'll have your wallet tied to the game already.  When you fire up COD, you'll have the same costume already.

Clover has a contest going on right now with NFTs that that you get for contributing to their crowd load.  It's basically like the McDonalds monopoly game.  If you match 5 green NFTs, you can trade that in for ~1 million.  If you get 5 yellow, it is 500k.  You can trade 3 of the lower NFTs for one higher color NFTs.  So you could trade 3 black NFTs for one blue NFT, 3 blues for 1 red, etc.  So obviously those NFTs have value because they can be traded.  If somebody has 4 greens, they could pay for 3 golds and then trade the 3 golds for a green.  What exactly is a fair price for 3 NFTs that can be combined and traded in for 1 million?  Obviously people are going to pay a lot for those.  How much would you pay for Boardwalk and Park Place in the McDonalds monopoly game?

But of course, the sound bite in the news will only say 'Clover NFT sold for 100k!'  And people like you who have no idea what is really going on think ""WOW, what a moron!  Who would spend 100k for a clover JPEG?""  Nah dude.  They spent 100k because the NFT is simply a game piece to unlock 1 million.",1,Reddit,adidas

Finally got the best result with contact lenses under protective sports eye wear (my friend couldn't use that combo due to excessive sweating, which irritaded his eyes beneath contact lenses too much..not my case though).

If i had to go back to wearing correction glasses and wasn't able to wear contact lenses, i'd go for two pairs od durable sport plastic glass frames-one completely transparent and other dimmed..swapping during the ride if needed.

BuyItForLife,20/12/2021 08:08:50 PM,hpc2q2t,"Does he need something that does well in wet/snow?  How about something that does well in heat, or different shoes for each?  I would suggest looking at cushioned running shoes, though they're likely to run you $100 - $150 per pair.

Adidas Boost shoes with Continental rubber outsoles can last a very long time, but they don't make much in the way of weather resistant shoes outside of a few gore-tex pairs, which will be great in winter, but terrible (too hot) in summer.  Reebok Floatride shoes are a little firmer than Boost, but use the same midsole materials.  They're not good for keeping feet dry though.  

Some of this depends on your husband's feet as well.  If midsole cushioning isn't a big issue, he can likely wait until the rubber outsole wears out, which will take much longer than midsole cushioning.  

Here are a couple of articles with some ideas.  They also have articles on softest running shoes, best for rain, etc.

[https://www.solereview.com/best-winter-running-shoes/](https://www.solereview.com/best-winter-running-shoes/)

[https://www.solereview.com/most-durable-running-shoes-of-2017/](https://www.solereview.com/most-durable-running-shoes-of-2017/)

Running shoes typically last 300-500 miles (reviews on SoleReview will give you a mileage estimate). Buying last year's model might be a good way to save money.  At the amount of mileage your husband walks (60-90 miles per week) he might need to replace even long distance shoes every couple of months.  But again, that's when the cushioning starts to give, and not necessarily when the outsole is gone.  

Good luck!",1,Reddit,adidas

A higher quality mat is worth the money compared to what you get in a cheaper mat, but even if it's an investment it's still a splurge and not everyone's in the position to do that. My mat was a BIG purchase for me after several years of on-and-off practice, but after biting the bullet and buying it, my practice really changed for the better. 

The Manduka EKO has good padding and is cheaper than the Manduka PRO series. It has a more rubbery smell but that doesn't bug me, though others find it very off-putting.

hockeyjerseys,20/12/2021 04:49:12 PM,hpb9bwi,"In no way am I disagreeing with this sentiment, but the Stadium Series jersey is usually ""whacky"" in some way. With Reebok I felt like the designs were decent, usually a mix of classy and progressive designs. With Adidas, they love one or both of two things: 1) two colors only and/or 2) a design based on the team's history or culture but one you would never want to see on a regular basis. Both of those points bother me *hard* because I feel like it ensures that the jersey will either be too wild to take seriously or too boring to care.

Anyway, all this to say that the navy alt probably should have been brought back for the winter classic (the road version/prototype would have worked) or better yet as the long term third jersey. At this point, I don't think it will ever happen. As someone else said here, once new ownership took over they did a whole rebrand and are so committed to the gold and blue that the Preds have not had a real third jersey since the navy alt was last worn ten years ago in 2011.",1,Reddit,adidas

Early said (through his attorney) that he was twice given envelopes by Gottfried to give to Smith's trainer that he presumed contained cash. Gottfried denies this and points out that other than Gassnola's testimony there is no evidence that the transfer from Adidas happened.

Smith denies ever getting any money.

&gt;Charlotte FC, an MLS expansion team which also starts play in 2022, experienced similar challenges with its primary kit, which was supposed to debut in mid-November. Adidas, which along with Fanatics is an apparel partner, paid an undisclosed cost in order to expedite the overseas shipment of the kit so that fans would have the opportunity to purchase it starting with its unveiling on Dec. 9.
&gt;
&gt;Team President Nick Kelly said there are now 10,000 primary kits available ‚Äî roughly split between Charlotte FC and Fanatics ‚Äî until more arrive in March or April of 2022. The team has about 100 different products to sell, he said, compared with what would normally be 400 to 500 items ‚Äúin an ideal world.‚Äù
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúI feel like sometimes we work for Macy‚Äôs,‚Äù said Kelly, noting the team‚Äôs practice of publicizing via social media newly available merchandise when it‚Äôs in stock. ‚ÄúFor the time being, every time we‚Äôve had something new drop, from a hat to a car sticker, we‚Äôve almost treated it like a catalog release because we want our fans to know what‚Äôs coming.‚Äù",1,Reddit,adidas

The Pegasus has an even bevel across the heel of the shoe whereas the Boston has a bevel on the outer edge only. If you‚Äôre landing on the inner edge of the shoe, the sharp angle at the back might act as a lever and torque your knee in ways that strain it. I ran into this issue with some adidas shoes.

Another thing is that if the Boston is a firmer shoe, the effective drop might be higher than a more cushy Pegasus. The Pegasus also has a decoupled grove in the back, that behaves in different ways depending on your weight. 

Drop isn‚Äôt everything, needs to take into account the shape and softness of the midsole.",1,Reddit,adidas

Conventional shoes like Nike and adidas shoes have a raised heel, narrow toe box, arch support, and toe spring. These are awful for your feet, and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôll be in pain if you‚Äôre on your feet for a whole shift.
Minimal shoes like Xero Shoes and Vivobarefoot shoes are sales like your feet, which is really good for your foot health. There‚Äôs a wide toe box which lets your toes spread out as the naturally should, there no raised heel, the sole is thin and flexible, there‚Äôs no support.
All of these features allow me to be pain free when I‚Äôm working on my feet for 8 hours per day. 

More support is worse. Less support is better. If you switch to minimalist shoes, there is a transition period that you need to navigate through because you‚Äôve been in conventional shoes for you whole life.

Me(21f) and my boyfriend (21m) went skiing this past weekend for my birthday. I had to pay for my own ticket and rental (100$) while his parents paid for his. He drove me so I paid for half the gas, and he made me pay for my food when we went out to eat at Waffle House. I also had a few beers that he brought, that he ended up asking me to pay for later as well. I can kinda understand all that, I‚Äôm not a brat and I don‚Äôt expect him to pay for everything on my birthday. However, I am kinda disappointed that he didn‚Äôt get me a gift. He‚Äôs pretty financially stable (his parents pay for everything, he has a nice car that he was given, he buys designer clothes, etc, while I work two jobs to afford college and save up for a car) His ‚Äúbirthday present‚Äù was the first hoodie he gave me while we were dating. We‚Äôve both worn it a lot over the years, he‚Äôs even let me keep it for months at a time, it‚Äôs nothing special it‚Äôs just an adidas hoodie that he has two of in different colors. He gives me old clothes that he doesn‚Äôt want All. The. Time. A week before my birthday, he mentioned wanting a  hoodie from an artist collab that he‚Äôs a fan of, so I bought one for his bday (in a month) for 120$(he knew I got it, just not which one) He‚Äôs a big smoker(legal state) and has been talking about saving money to spend on weed. The day after my birthday, he goes and drops 200$ on weed when he already has about 150$ worth. Am I an asshole for being kinda hurt that he didn‚Äôt buy me anything? I appreciate the gesture, it just makes me feel like he cares more about smoking than me. He can spend his money on whatever he wants, it‚Äôs just upsetting that he talked about saving money for more weed, and he did so by not buying me a present. I might be the asshole because I did tell him I didn‚Äôt want him spending too much money on me, and I might low key be resentful that I have to work so hard for my money and I still spend so much on him.

Tinder,20/12/2021 02:27:16 AM,hp8vxfg,"The photo quality is very good, but certain photos aren't as good for dating apps. The black/white one under a bridge, for example, is artsy and looks nice, but doesn't show you clearly enough to be good for your profile. Remember the intent of what photos you're using; you wanna show what you look like in various contexts.

Your first photo in the blue jacket is very nice; the color composition, smile, etc is great. The photo of you standing by the graffiti'd wall is cool, but a bit far away; can be fine to leave in if complemented with other photos. The one of you working on a piece of art is nice but shows you from the back, so it also needs support from more photos showing you specifically. The photo of you with the dog is nice -- maybe a bit over-saturated which distorts the image, but that doesn't detract too much.

The photo of you taking a picture in the forested kinda cove I think doesn't work very well; your face is covered, the lighting is dimmed from the shade -- it's a nice photo but doesn't work well for dating apps.

The last photo of the guy in the Adidas outfit I don't really get, but maybe it's a meme or reference I'm not familiar with.

Overall; have more photos that are closer or mid-range and that show your face in good, clear lighting and detail. Besides that, you've got a really solid eye for photo composition, it's just in applying that so your profile is more balanced and works better for the fact that it's a dating app.",1,Reddit,adidas

DebateAVegan,20/12/2021 01:30:52 AM,hp8p03t,"&gt; I am just saying this action is wrong. It‚Äòs not balance when you do some good things and some bad things. If you acknowledge something is wrong and especially if it is easy to change, as you have said this would be for you, then you should change it.

The problem is, I'm extremely self-reflective. So if I were to apply this consistently then that would be demanding perfection from myself which as a flawed human is a standard I cannot live up to. 

It's not a matter of 'letting myself off the hook', it's a matter of being realistic and finding a balance where you are comfortable. 

&gt; I am absolutely not asking more of you than I ask of myself

That's actually a good question.  I don't know of any instance where clothing is protected in such a way.  Wear whatever you want. Also, I think commercially available products are fine too.   
A poster that everyone can buy, and you purchased it, should be protected as wall decor. But you cannot use the image from that poster in your podcast cover art. See the difference? 

The good news is that most times, if someone feels you've violated their copyright, they'll send a warning first and give you a chance to correct it.  If you make public videos, this is going to happen sooner or later. It doesn't mean you are intentionally malicious, it just happens. 

But all I know is the basics based on my own experiences, and what clients have experienced over the years and helping them navigate it. If you need detailed legal advice, you should consult with an attorney.",1,Reddit,nike
playboicarti,30/12/2021 03:32:00 PM,hqk0fqy,"Narcissism? As in Playboi Carti Narcissist?

Jordan Terrell Carter (born September 13, 1996), known professionally as Playboi Carti, is an American rapper and singer-songwriter. He is recognized for his experimental musical style, gothic fashion, and mysterious public persona. Born and raised in Atlanta, Carti was initially signed to local underground label Awful Records prior to signing with ASAP Mob's AWGE Label under Interscope Records. After gaining a cult following early in his career, Carti gained mainstream attention in 2017.

Carti's debut mixtape was released in April 2017, and included the Billboard Hot 100 charting singles ""Magnolia"" and ""Woke Up Like This"" (featuring Lil Uzi Vert). His debut studio album Die Lit (2018) peaked at number 3 on the US Billboard 200. Following a two-year hiatus with little new music released, Carti's highly anticipated second album, Whole Lotta Red (2020), debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and became his first chart-topping release.

Early life:

Jordan Terrell Carter was born in Atlanta, Georgia, and grew up in Fairburn, Georgia. In a 2016 interview with Complex he stated, ""My ma couldn't tell me shit. Nobody could tell me shit."" This type of lifestyle influenced Carter to get into trouble as a youth and sway away from the idea of pursuing a higher level of education after high school. He attended North Springs Charter High School in Sandy Springs. Before rap, Carter wanted to become an NBA star to try and make something of himself. In an interview with The Fader Carti said ""I was a young AI and didn't go to practice. That was the time I was really ducking school and it was all hoop and no rap. I would smoke before practice, get on the court and drop 30."" He stopped playing basketball after a disagreement with his coach, and then dedicated his time to music. Carter skipped high school classes regularly to work on his music or go to his job at H&amp;M which led to Carti barely graduating high school. In an interview with The Fader he said, ""I was in class with freshmen finishing work, and if I finished the nine assignments before this time I could graduate."" He was so close to not graduating that no one showed up to his graduation because they didn't know he was going to graduate. Carti hated the idea of being an upcoming rapper working at H&amp;M, so he made the decision to quit.

Carti shopped in thrift stores in his youth, something that has had an effect on his fashion and music style.

Career:

2011‚Äì2016: Beginnings
Carti began rapping at an early age under the name Sir Cartier in 2011 and soon after changed it to Playboi Carti in 2013. Much of his early work has been deleted from the Internet. In 2014, after meeting producer Ethereal, he joined Awful Records. Carti credits Ethereal with helping him find his sound. Once Carti chose to pursue music full-time he made the decision to move to New York City with some family. Being in New York City Carti had made the decision to stay at his drug dealer's house. Members of ASAP were in and out of the house Carti stayed at. Eventually Carti ran into ASAP Bari, a founding member of ASAP who already knew about his music. ASAP Bari eventually introduced Carti to ASAP Rocky.ASAP Rocky was so influential to Carti that he decided to stay with him in Texas instead of going back to New York City. In 2015 at a show at SXSW, Carti met ASAP Rocky, who mentored Carti. He then began to attract attention in 2015 with his singles ""Broke Boi"" and ""Fetti"" featuring Da$h and Maxo Kream, both of which were published to SoundCloud. Around this time, Carti frequently collaborated with artists in Atlanta's underground rap scene, including his cousin UnoTheActivist, Thouxanbanfauni, Yung Bans, Lil Yachty, Ethereal, and producers MexikoDro, and ICYTWAT. Furthermore, he began to tour with ASAP Ferg and Lil Uzi Vert and signed a deal with Interscope Records.

In 2016, he was featured on the A$AP Mob's single ""Telephone Calls"" from their album Cozy Tapes Vol. 1: Friends. The same year, Carti signed to the A$AP Mob's AWGE imprint and Interscope Records.

2017‚Äì2018: Playboi Carti and Die Lit
Carti released his eponymous debut mixtape in April 2017. The release gained attention from various music publications, including XXL, Pitchfork, Spin, HotNewHipHop, and PopMatters, and reached No. 12 on the Billboard 200. The mixtape spawned two successful singles: ""Magnolia"", which reached number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100, and ""Woke Up Like This"" featuring Lil Uzi Vert, which reached number 76. Accompanying the mixtape's release, Carti embarked on a tour with Gucci Mane and Dreezy. On June 13, 2017, Playboi Carti was named as one of the ten of XXL's ""2017 Freshman Class"". Around this time, he was featured on A$AP Mob's single ""Raf"" from their album Cozy Tapes Vol. 2: Too Cozy and Lana Del Rey's single ""Summer Bummer"" from her album Lust for Life.

On May 11, 2018, Carti released his debut full-length album Die Lit, which peaked at number 3 on the US Billboard 200. Months later, in August 2018, Carti announced his second studio album Whole Lotta Red.

2019‚Äìpresent: Whole Lotta Red
Carti began work on his second album Whole Lotta Red late in 2018. Over the next two years, many of Carti's songs were leaked onto the internet and accumulated tens of millions of streams. He did not release any original music, instead being featured on numerous singles, including ""Baguettes in the Face"" featuring NAV and A Boogie wit da Hoodie from DJ Mustard's album and ""Earfquake"" by Tyler the Creator. In April 2020, Carti released his first new music since 2018 with the song ""@ Meh"", which peaked at number 35 on the Hot 100. The following month, he was featured on the single ""Pain 1993"" by Drake, which debuted at number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became Carti's first top-ten on the chart. On November 23, 2020, Carti announced that Whole Lotta Red was complete and had been submitted to his label. On Thanksgiving Day, 2020, Carti was featured on Lil Yachty's deluxe album Lil Boat 3.5 on the song ""Flex Up"" with Future. The following month, hip-hop commentator DJ Akademiks announced that Whole Lotta Red was scheduled for a Christmas Day release. Carter confirmed the Christmas release date on December 21, 2020. On December 25, 2020, Carti released the 24-track long album Whole Lotta Red. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, becoming Carti's first chart-topping release. In June 2021, Carti was featured on rapper Lil 1 DTE's single, ""Homixide"" from his self-titled mixtape. In August 2021, Playboi Carti was featured on the songs ""Off the Grid"", ""Junya"", and ""Junya, Pt. 2"" in Kanye West's album Donda.

Modeling
Carter's fashion style is one of the main features of his public image. GQ has defined Carter as the ""leader of a youth style"", and said that he represents a stylistic midpoint between the ""fashion gloss of A$AP Mob, the punk-rock attitude of Uzi Vert, and the playful camp of Yachty.""

Carter's favorite designer is Raf Simons and favorite designer label is Balmain. Carter met Simons at a fashion show in New York City.
Carter is featured on the song ""RAF"" by A$AP Mob, which was dedicated to Raf Simons. The music video for the song included Carter, A$AP Rocky, and Quavo wearing rare Raf Simons-designed clothing. Carter considers Kanye West and A$AP Rocky inspirations for his fashion style.

Carter has modeled numerous times, including for Louis Vuitton, Kanye West's Yeezy Season 5, VFiles, and Drake's OVO Lookbook, alongside Ian Connor and John Ross.

He was in a commercial for Nike, Inc. and walked the runway for Virgil Abloh and his brand Off-White. He designs for Vlone.

Musical Style:

Carter has been described as a ""mumble rapper"", and his music as ""playful, hard-hitting, and very melodic."" Complex called his style of rapping ""spare and repetitive, more concerned with flow and catchy phrases."" Briana Younger at Pitchfork said that ""Carti‚Äôs music is less about lyricism and more about atmosphere"", going on to say that ""whatever Carti lacks in substance he makes up in sheer audacity.""

Carter is known for his ""baby voice"" technique, characterized by his voice hitting high pitches with unclear pronunciations and frantic cadences.[48] He has used this technique on popular songs such as ""Almeda"" with Solange, ""Earfquake"" with Tyler, the Creator, and ""Pissy Pamper"" with Young Nudy and Pi'erre Bourne.

The New York Times said Carti's rapping made it appear as if he was ""more at ease with the performance of the role than with the actual act of rapping.""

He uses Satanic imagery. His style is influenced by vampire movies. Lil Wayne inspired him to freestyle all of his raps.",1,Reddit,nike

These could have been given to homeless people, donated to charity and those that are in need.

They specifically choose not to help those that are in need, they act as if poverty is a choice for people and therefore choose not to help out.

Porra, 20 anos atr√°s o maluco escreveu que ia ter doid√£o que ia querer casar com a Hatsune Miku em VR. N√£o √© uma parada nova, sabe? A √∫nica diferen√ßa √© que antes era isso ‚Äî imagina√ß√£o. Um livro. Era t√£o distante da nossa realidade que era fic√ß√£o. E a√≠, a gente volta prum problema do primeiro paragrafo, que √© acesso limitado. Por um lado, √© muito doido estar aqui porque o que chega aqui j√° passou por um filtro coletivo americano, por exemplo. A gente n√£o traduz toda obra publicada em ingl√™s, apenas as que a gente tem interesse, ent√£o √© √≥bvio que a gente recebe Neuromancer aqui ‚Äî mas o americano, o americano t√° lendo tudo quanto √© groselha. 

Essa barreira a√≠ que eu acabei de descrever t√° sendo quebrada com o Globalismo/Globaliza√ß√£o ‚Äî antes era normal tu lan√ßar um produto no US, esperar um ano, lan√ßar na Europa. Testar mesmo. Hoje as mesmas empresas mostram Ads nesses pa√≠ses, mensuram a rea√ß√£o, e a√≠ sim decidem se vale a pena desenvolver o produto baseado no interesse. A gente t√° cortando algumas etapas que, com a internet, permite com que a gente interaja com o mundo de forma diferente. Ler outra l√≠ngua ao vivo em tempo real sem a necessidade de uma pessoa traduzindo adiciona uma camada de compreens√£o na conviv√™ncia humana que √© francamente novo e a gente t√° se adaptando a isso.

A internet √© a forma como a gente se adapta ‚Äî primeiro a gente aprendeu a mandar carta digital. Escrever. A√≠ a gente conseguiu colocar figuras. E v√≠deos? E se as figuras se mexessem? Como a gente otimiza como tudo isso se conecta? E por a√≠ vai. A Web 2.0 foi montada na base do que sobrou p√≥s bolha dotcom (Google, Amazon, etc) e o resultado foi o que a gente viu entre socializa√ß√£o em larga escala (que j√° ocorria nos livros citados l√° em cima, refer√™ncia fodida pra todo mundo que t√° desenvolvendo essa jo√ßa desde a d√©cada de 90), monetiza√ß√£o, os primeiros produtos globais digitais (coca-cola √© f√≠sico, facebook √© digital) ‚Äî e a valoriza√ß√£o dessas empresas no mercado. O termo petr√≥-dolares foi cunhado quando a economia global girava ao redor do petr√≥leo ‚Äî hoje, das 5 empresas mais valiosas do mundo, s√≥ uma ainda √© de petr√≥leo. Todas as outras s√£o empresas de experi√™ncias. O Google n√£o √© mais s√≥ um produto, a Amazon n√£o √© mais s√≥ um produto, s√£o experi√™ncias que voc√™ sem d√∫vida alguma em algum momento da vida, se viver no mundo ocidental, vai cruzar com, ou precisar de ‚Äî mas a gente n√£o tem um termpo t√£o daora pra isso quanto petro-d√≥lares.

Beleza, montamos a web2.0, os tit√£s se consolidaram M√ÉS se voc√™ estudar como o mercado de capitais funciona, funciona na base da especula√ß√£o ‚Äî qual √© o pr√≥ximo ouro? qual √© o pr√≥ximo investimento que tem um potencial de retorno t√£o grande quanto petr√≥leo teve? √â disso que vive o capitalismo (e a inova√ß√£o privada), as vezes at√© largando o brinquedo de lado. 

Beleza, mas porque eu falei tudo isso? Porque a web2.0 estagnou, j√°. Virou status quo ‚Äî quando o Instagram precisa por um banner e advertising no ponto de √¥nibus pra se manter relevante, apesar do tamanho tit√¢nico do produto, significa que o crescimento org√¢nico e a fase de crescimento do produto acabou. Netflix, streaming, todas essas coisas j√° viraram cotidiano, deixou de ser um ""mercado de nicho"". Tua m√£e sabe o que √© live agora, e se n√£o sabe, vai descobrir nos pr√≥ximos anos porque o neto vai pedir pra por a live daqui 10 anos ent√£o t√° tranquilo. O shift de paradigma J√Å rolou. √â s√≥ uma quest√£o de quem e quando vai virar a chave. Tem gente que nunca precisa. A√≠ vira circunstancial, como localidade ‚Äî mas, de novo, pelo acesso louco e globalizado que a gente tem hoje, nosso paradigma √© completamente diferente de sei l√°, 10 anos atr√°s.

Se 10 anos atr√°s eu quisesse investir em petr√≥leo era uma puta trampo, ano passado tava dando pra tradear barril na Avenue tendo 5 mil reais na conta do banco. As barreiras est√£o deixando de serem f√≠sicas pra serem... bom, financeiras. Que j√° eram antes, tamb√©m (s√≥ quem tem dinheiro tem acesso a mobilidade global etc etc), e a√≠, considerando que a gente n√£o t√° abrindo mais as fronteiras do mundo, pra onde tu cresce? Pro virtual.

Fez esse pote todo ai, e a√≠ a gente tem a web3.0. Tem muiita gente inovando (assim como tinha uma rapazeada que pensava ""porra ia ser mo daora mostrar esse gif na mesa com meus brothers"" e da√≠ criou-se o YouTube, fazendo coisa usando a pr√≥pria internet e tudo que a gente j√° criou nesse landscape virtual pra tentar fazer coisa nova. A √∫nica diferen√ßa √© que ao inv√©s de ter meia d√∫zia de caboclos no vale do sil√≠cio fazendo isso num bunker, agora eles t√£o fazendo no twitter de uma forma muito mais p√∫blica, mas a premissa de que √© um espa√ßo de especula√ß√£o e inova√ß√£o (e venda de sonhos, como voc√™s pontuaram) √© que torna a parada t√£o atraente. 

Eu particularmente acho que √© um caminho sem volta, e por mais que eu curta e esteja pessoalmente investido na parada, tenho completo entendimento de duas coisas:

\- me √© agrad√°vel porque eu tenho a op√ß√£o de viver fora do metaverso (minha vida real √© daora)

\- eu tenho maturidade pra saber separar as coisas

&amp;#x200B;

assim como YouTube, Instagram, etc, criou uma ""classe"" nova de pessoas (influenciadores, criadores de conteudo, fandom, abriu as portas pra que esports se tornasse vi√°vel), acho que web3.0 e metaverso segue o mesmo caminho. Vai ter algum tipo de experi√™ncia pra todo mundo ‚Äî pro consumidor que s√≥ quer ter algum tipo de entretinemento, pro cara que quer viver disso, e pro cara que quer explorar esse mercado.

Nike tried helping him out but that seemed to waffle between ineffective and backfiring depending on which even you want to discuss.

When did Roger Goodell acknowledge that he should have listened?  (And that assumes we take his words at face value.)  June 2020.

What year did the NBA pause their playoffs (a money printing machine if ever there were one) for a statement of solidarity?  2020

2020 did more to raise awareness about police brutality than he ever managed to do, and that's ***not a criticism of him***, but a dose of reality for people who want protests to stay polite and out of the way and *ignorable.*  Colin did it the way folks claim they want him done, and 0 change was enacted.

I don't think 2020 achieved more than baby steps either in the end with regard to policy change, but it's more than we've done in my lifetime, more than Rodney King's beating achieved, and more than a year later I'm still routinely talking about police brutality with people I *never* discussed it with before, and it seems a big segment of the country also is.

The piece of clothing it‚Äôs on is a sweatshirt style jumper from Kmart Australia and the threads are ones that were lying around at home.

My inspiration for this was the similarly done Nike logos with embroidery, but TWICE (the group, that‚Äôs their logo) is my friend‚Äôs favourite band and the threads are her favourite colours.

No machine sewing involved, and although it looks tricky, only a few stitch types were used (running stitch, french knot, chain stitch/lazy daisy, bullions)

I found it easier to use an embroidery hoop, and once the fabric was in, gently pull the edges out to bring tautness to the fabric so embroidering was easier.

Lamo man, you started with the cocky tone, I just picked up on it, but this is a Philly sub, so it aint really out of place :D  
  
&gt;Yes, it changed from the 2017 season. That is not what I am fucking talking about whatsoever nor was it my claim. Idk how I can make that any clearer. I am talking about the change that took place pre 2014 season. Before said fabric change, Nike had the color exactly right in the first two seasons post Nike takeover. It only became an issue after they changed the type of fabric used before the 2014 season.  
  
Okay, lets brake this down bc you are not getting what I am saying and actually providing a source for:  
 - Your claim: The colour changed in '14, bc of a different fabric used.  
 - My claim: The color changed when Nike took over manufacturing completely, bc they use a different color.  
Timeline:  
 - 12-13: Nike making the Jerseys, they look the same as rebook, bc they use the Rebook template, but now manufactured by Nike.  
 - 14: Nike introduce its own Jerseys, visible difference in color.  
 - 17: Nike confirms that it change color **FROM** SPORT TEAL to deep teal, non of witch is midnight green, so the only time Nike manufactured midnight green is when they used the Rebook template.

[I disagree. Zuck and Facebook have been in on VR/AR since even before Cambridge Analytica scandal. They‚Äôve been pouring money into it for years. This is not a marketing thing. It‚Äôs legitimately their long game.   Zuckerberg sees the current mobile environment dominated by Google and Apple as a risk for Facebook which it is. To him the next progression from mobile is to AR/VR and the quicker the transition happens the better it is for FB.   Think of how Google and Apple are to the mobile internet. You wouldn‚Äôt say Google owns the mobile internet but they do own the platform through which most of us interact with it as well as key apps that we use in it.   That‚Äôs what FBs long game is for AR/VR. To own the platform that allow us to interact with it, keys apps within it, and the hardware we use to access it. To be for AR/VR what Google/Apple for mobile and what Microsoft was for computers.   The desire to front run everyone is because the faster the transition occurs the faster FB can move away from the shadow of Google and Apple and the risk that carries. Whether or not he‚Äôs right about VR/AR is to be seen but he‚Äôs got a track record of success.](/r/stocks/comments/rql9cs/what_are_your_top_picks_for_a_metaverse_portfolio/hqbfi0i/)

BizSMG,30/12/2021 12:37:38 PM,hqjfsmg,"[I don't analyse sectors so I have no idea. I look for individual stocks I can understand so I naturally avoid most sectors because I have little understanding of companies in spaces like pharma, banking, materials, etc.  I'm a software engineer so I generally invest in tech companies as I understand that sector better than most. I also look for high-growth companies and tend to stay away from stocks where you pay a premium for stability which in theory should result in higher average returns, but this also means most of my stock picks wouldn't be considered pure ""value"" plays and generally have high, or in some cases non-existent PEs. So I'm not sure how helpful my picks are if you're looking for sectors/stocks with value in the traditional sense...  That said, there are a lot of small US tech stocks I really like right now. I think UPST is looking very attractive at its current valuation and I've been buying looking for a pop. Stocks like PLAN, YEXT &amp; COUR are all small, high risk names, but I think they have been treated quite unfairly by the market this past year and worth putting a bit of money in.  Internationally I like OZON and BABA. These are generally seen as toxic stocks to investors here, but both have strong growth and wide moats in their respective countries so long as you can get past the political concerns. I own these partly for international exposure so wouldn't necessary recommend either to the average investor.  The other half of my portfolio is much more generic though. I own names like DIS, AMZN, GOOG, SHOP, TSM. Some of which I think are a little pricey, but they have safety in their size and don't seem to be excessively valued. I also own a small amount of a few random stocks like BA and BRKB purely for diversification and couldn't really comment on valuation.  In general I'm much more concerned with avoiding bubbles and excessively high valuations. Until recently I owned names like NVDA and NET, but have cut these because of their valuations. I don't really care about 20-30% pullbacks, I just want to avoid the 90% drawdowns which would risk wiping out my portfolio. I think in general investors spend too much time seeking returns and not enough minimising the risk of catastrophic events. With the exception of BA and BKRB all the stocks I've named here could easily double or more over the next 2-3 years and I believe all are also very unlikely to see more than 50% declines even in the worst case scenarios. I could see an investment in Bitcoin, Tesla, GME doubling in 2022 too, but all could quite easily fall 90%+ in a worst case so are not worth the risk.](/r/stocks/comments/rqxfj8/the_biggest_difference_between_19982000_and/hqeklxj/)

V is working with financial institutions to make deals that will eventually accept crypto.   On the bearish side of things, there are rumors of regulatory crackdown on V for shady backroom, monopolistic practices. Rumors that they worked with PYPL and SQ in a way to squeeze out competition. Also on the bear side, that AMZN is removing Visa from prime purchases in Europe.  I still like V, and I'll continue to buy more.](/r/stocks/comments/rqf27z/visa_vs_mastercard_is_there_a_difference_between/hqbtd4q/)

[Well, you can actually do this strategy with really big money, on huge mega cap companies that you have unlimited faith in. For example, Microsoft and Google. Basically a scalping strategy. If MSFT or GOOG turns against you, you just turn into a long-term investor. Now the key is, you get way more daily and weekly wins before you end up stuck for several months on a bad entry.  Still, if you think about it, let's say you had a bad entry on MSFT, and you're down in the stock, and all your money is stuck, not doing any work for you. What about the long-term investor planning to hold MSFT for multiple years that bought on that same day, at that same price? They're no better off than you. They also have dead money. They just have a longer time horizon.   The strategy can be argued both ways. It's better to just buy a stock and hold it for years, or try to constantly scalp it, and if you get stuck, you get stuck. It'd be interesting to compare two investors. One, buying and holding for 13 months. The other guy doing nothing but scalping in the same ticker. Which one ends up making more money? I think in the case of something like AMZN, the guy scalping would have actually done considerably better.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rrhagq/albert_einstein_of_the_stock_markets/hqi85l4/)

I really can‚Äôt wrap my head around the idea that all these major hedge funds have spend literally all their resources for the last year shorting the stock over and over again, been paying people to stay in office around the clock, and hiring people to write counter DD on Reddit just to trick people into selling.

You can make up whatever dark-pool bullshit you think is happening but the real reason is very simple; there‚Äôs virtually no institutional ownership of GME. When AAPL dips, there‚Äôs plenty of institutions that were happy to hold at $170, so they will start buying at $168. But GME dips and nobody wants to buy besides retail, and retail doesn‚Äôt have enough power to keep things steady.   The MOASS is real, but it already happened.

ARKK should've just followed Buffett's lead and become a quasi TSLA tracking company like how BRK.A/B track AAPL + big banks.  TSLA should be like 20-25% of ARKK... not 8.4% which it would be if they'd kept their 3-4 million shares instead of trimming all the way down to 1.3 million.

So by construction, aren't you just forcing yourself to get rid of your best investments and hold onto your worst investments for the sake of keeping this balanced?   I understand setting limits on how much additional money you invest (i.e., your cost basis), but I'm not understanding the value in capping the total market value.

[""Although the commercial truck segment of Mobileye‚Äôs business is ramping up quickly now, the company‚Äôs long-term growth will be in the passenger vehicle market, he said.""  so once again, Mobileye focuses on the passenger cars?? It's very  different when a company develops self driving tech for passenger cars and then switches over to try to make it work for trucks. Compared to TuSimple which was always focused on trucking and specifically developed the long range computer vision that heavy duty class 8 trucks need due to the fact that when fully loaded they can weigh up to 80,000 pounds and therefore need longer time to brake compared to smaller passenger cars. TuSimple also has the advantage of having a deep knowledge of how the trucking industry operates with executives from UPS etc.  &amp;#x200B;  AND you've completely missed the whole point of this post which is that TuSimple completely removed any humans from the vehicle during the demo. That is very different from mobileye which has a safety driver in the driver's seat ready to take over at any time. It takes time and technological maturity to be confident that the autonomous vehicle can successfully and consistently navigate anything that comes up while self driving on public roads without any humans on board ready to take over  Like what????

[I disagree. I think if you're red this year, you need to reevaluate your strategy and figure out why. The market was a fucking kangaroo this year, and even good stocks that made record profits were getting absolutely clobbered. If you invested ANYTHING in China, you're down almost 25% on the year not based on fundamental performance but rather on investor sentiment.  Growth got clobbered by receding P/S multipliers, which again is market sentiment not performance. Good companies with solid revenue gains still got hit hard. ENPH which crushed expectations on earnings and revenue is still trading at about 10% down YTD. ENPH had a 50/50 coinflip. If you bought ENPH in Jan, Feb, Jul, Aug, Oct, Nov, you'd be down for the year. Ifbought it you bought it any other months, you'd be up.  Would you consider V or PYPL bad companies? If you bought either in the first 8 months, you'd be down almost 20% (down 35% with PYPL)  Same with ANYTHING in fintech that wasn't a traditional bank. SQ, SOFI, AFRM, UPST, etc.  I don't think just giving up because the few stocks you picked that were roaring. Maybe adjusting the strategy a bit to balance out stocks with an index to gauge performance or valuation may be a better strategy than just giving up.](/r/stocks/comments/rrhoka/to_all_of_you_who_are_red_this_year_while_the/hqi4oh6/)

BizSMG,30/12/2021 12:22:21 PM,hqjeet7,"[I don't analyse sectors so I have no idea. I look for individual stocks I can understand so I naturally avoid most sectors because I have little understanding of companies in spaces like pharma, banking, materials, etc.  I'm a software engineer so I generally invest in tech companies as I understand that sector better than most. I also look for high-growth companies and tend to stay away from stocks where you pay a premium for stability which in theory should result in higher average returns, but this also means most of my stock picks wouldn't be considered pure ""value"" plays and generally have high, or in some cases non-existent PEs. So I'm not sure how helpful my picks are if you're looking for sectors/stocks with value in the traditional sense...  That said, there are a lot of small US tech stocks I really like right now. I think UPST is looking very attractive at its current valuation and I've been buying looking for a pop. Stocks like PLAN, YEXT &amp; COUR are all small, high risk names, but I think they have been treated quite unfairly by the market this past year and worth putting a bit of money in.  Internationally I like OZON and BABA. These are generally seen as toxic stocks to investors here, but both have strong growth and wide moats in their respective countries so long as you can get past the political concerns. I own these partly for international exposure so wouldn't necessary recommend either to the average investor.  The other half of my portfolio is much more generic though. I own names like DIS, AMZN, GOOG, SHOP, TSM. Some of which I think are a little pricey, but they have safety in their size and don't seem to be excessively valued. I also own a small amount of a few random stocks like BA and BRKB purely for diversification and couldn't really comment on valuation.  In general I'm much more concerned with avoiding bubbles and excessively high valuations. Until recently I owned names like NVDA and NET, but have cut these because of their valuations. I don't really care about 20-30% pullbacks, I just want to avoid the 90% drawdowns which would risk wiping out my portfolio. I think in general investors spend too much time seeking returns and not enough minimising the risk of catastrophic events. With the exception of BA and BKRB all the stocks I've named here could easily double or more over the next 2-3 years and I believe all are also very unlikely to see more than 50% declines even in the worst case scenarios. I could see an investment in Bitcoin, Tesla, GME doubling in 2022 too, but all could quite easily fall 90%+ in a worst case so are not worth the risk.](/r/stocks/comments/rqxfj8/the_biggest_difference_between_19982000_and/hqeklxj/)

[That‚Äôs a good amount of money!   Conservatively I would do VOO, an index that shadows the S&amp;P. A little more aggressively you can plant it in VGT, which is a bit more volatile but being so tech heavy has seen higher gains the last 2 years.  Otherwise with that money I would diversify in a few other areas. DIS seems low right now- you could bag 100 for 15k. Also could go for some MSFT with some growth and a small dividend (feels safe to me at this time). FB/MVRS I would expect larger growth over the next 2-4 years as well- but this is a higher risk. If you‚Äôre ok with volatility that‚Äôs my advice.  *Edited to add: i was a travel OT! Travel nursing is the best decision you can make for yourselves right now.

[A good movie doesn't move the needle with Disney as much as many people imagine.  Their theme parks are very seasonal and inflation will not help their already high prices.  Disney+ is great, but subscriber growth is markedly slowing as COVID 'eases' and they get closer to market saturation.  Netflix had the same explosive growth for a time, but eventually, most of the people who were likely to use the service had already become subscribers.  It will still grow, but I think we're past the time of it being a major boon to the stock price.  I 100% think the stock price will increase slowly over time, but the path will be bumpy and there are other stocks that I foresee doing better long-term.  I don't foresee DIS 'shooting up' or 'popping' as you suggested, but here's hoping.

It was... well, let's just be diplomatic and say that Manpanion and his BFF had a lovely time and I managed to get in some long jogs around their very suburban neighborhood while BFF's wife hid in her room, which would have been more relaxing if it wasn't all within ten yards of I87. 

So now I'm back at work for my first week as the only paid employee, and I've already gotten to start it by unpackaging all the billing the outgoing guy ""organized"" for me. I'm irritated by the fact that we've been spending $20/week in shipping fees in addition to the heinous quantities of paper we've been wasting on this process when all we had to do was scan a SINGLE SHEET OF INFORMATION for each patient into our system and then push a button to let our billing people access it.

I guess that's what happens when your body is finally able to, like, absorb calories instead of desperately shitting them out? FML. I dug the screw shoes out of retirement for an outside run yesterday since with COVID blowing up again I suspect my time in the gym will be limited. I am disgruntled.

End of the day, it's your money, your decision.  


Call me over doing it, but sometimes when I receive pairs (regardless from which facility or platform) if I feel something is off, I'll checkcheck to be sure. It's like asking for a second opinion and it doesn't cost much.  


Variations are normal. Noone can expect Nike/Adidas to produce 1,000,000+ pairs that are identical. Different parts of the leather roll / materials won't be the same and not all workers are going to be 100% accurate like the guy before him.

For the tempo vs zf4 debate. It's pretty much the same for the alpha vs vaporfly debate. Much like the alphafly, the tempo excels in longer, faster runs while the zf4 excels in shorter, faster runs. It depends on what you are racing for currently.

However, if your on a budget, i'd say go with the tempo. The ZF4 is pretty recent while the tempo has been released for a while so more chances for bigger discount. I personally got lucky and got the tempo for 90$ which is the best price value for such a premium shoe.

webdev,30/12/2021 09:48:59 AM,hqj26x7,"So first of all, your posts are massively contradictory, so I suspect you're actually pretty deep in the cult, and are just wasting my time, but I'll bite anyway. I mean, why would someone who:

&gt; admit that I have a very limited understanding of this

also be someone who:

&gt; I‚Äôm heavily invested in [Cardano]

right? You see my confusion? Anyway.

The context for your question is ""use of a blockchain as a currency in a nation"", so let's see about *that specific context*. We're not talking about investing, we're not talking about cross-border value transfer, we're talking about *using it as a currency*. So:

&gt; protection against inflation

Inflation, in the sense in which you're talking about it, is a product of certain real-world supply/demand issues (of goods/services), that then manifests in increased prices and lowering of purchasing power. Simpletons claim that because a cryptos money supply is outside of anyone's control, that this prevents inflation! But... those real world supply/demand issues that would've caused inflation... are still possible. We've not done anything about those. So, the government have one less tool at their disposal to try and combat such instabilities and issues (they can't print money, which *can be* a good thing to do), but the instabilities can still exist. So you're still going to get problems. Instead of the government printing money, traders will simply increase their prices. They'll have to. The on-the-ground underlying physical world problems are still present.

Zero for one.

&gt; lower fees

I don't even know what *you* think this means. ""Lower"" fees compared to what?! There are no transaction fees when I go pay Asda for my shopping. There are no fees when I go to the newsagent and by a chocolate bar with physical money. With a blockchain? Fees for *everything*.

Zero for two.

&gt; lower risk of fraud if you're using a hardware wallet

Most fraud is social engineering and this will not change. People get their crypto/NFTs phished away from them all the time, and this will still occur.

Zero for three.

&gt; [country] is working on a digital currency

News reports about countries ""looking into"" such things doesn't mean they actually are intending to deploy it. It means they're investigating to see if there's any benefits. Also, the overlap between ""idealistic blockchain pusher's utopian crypto attributes"" and ""anything the CCP puts out"" will be zero. The purported benefits of blockchains are public ownership yada yada, and while there's are lies at the best of times, any system the CCP goes with will not even have the illusion of them; it'll entirely be under the CCP's control and be a further tool to clamp down on the population. Please get a clue.

Zero for four.

&gt; Major companies [...] are in this space

Are they? Or are they just hedging their own bets? Money talks, bro, and the money men behind e.g. Nike do not give one shit about the ethical/social/technological/environmental impact of any given venture if they think it'll turn a profit and be good PR. With all the hype around this nonsense right now, sure, they're hoping to ride the wave, and taking a wee punt that *if* this turns into the underpinnings of the internet (fucking we should hope not) then they'll have skin in the game. This *does not* mean they ""believe in it"" or think it is ""a good thing"".

Zero for five.

The underlying reality is that these things are pyramid schemes and there's no escaping that. It's *mathe-fucking-matical*. You can't escape maths.",1,Reddit,nike

ArtHistory,30/12/2021 07:46:47 AM,hqisrpb,"This is then most famous to you.  Specifically.    
Hilma af Klimt, as an example, is much more of an academic's or conniseurs selection.  Her recognition there has only come about in the last couple of decades. I would even argue that the choice you made of her works is not even the more famous.  If you go by birthplace alone and not where they worked I would argue for Claes Oldenburg simply in that showing picture of any of his large public works next to a picture of an af Klimt people would simply recognize the Oldenburg.  In Sweden itself neither would be in the running, don't even think the average Swede realizes Oldenburg is Swedish. A work by Zorn or Milles would more likely have instant recognition.  
For the UK the choice of Turner is possibly 100 years out of date as most famous. People today would recognize a Banksy before any Turner, including ""The Fighting Temeraire"".  I would put forth a similar argument for France. While Delacroix liberty does have high cultural standing in France would it actually be as instantly recognizable to the typical ""man in the street"" in the rest of Europe or the world.  One would like to think that Monet would claim that, but most likely not, it would be art that has high popular art recognition. Perhaps Rodin's ""The Thinker""  


The largest contention I have with the list is the inclusion of the Parthenon, with exclusion of other architiecture.  Famous in this respect would drown out most of the art you have shown here.  You could not in such case ignore the Eifel Tower, the Leaning tower of Pisa, Stonehenge, and countless other candidates that have more recognition.  Perhaps the Elgin marbles taken from the Parthenon as a specific art work but then would they have more general recognition than Nike of Samorthrace.  


Your map is an interesting conversation starter but without a better definition of what constitutes ""famous art works"" it will find more contention than agreement.  The genericness of the title one would expect more well known works as opposed to personal preferences.",1,Reddit,nike

So, they may sell name brand items (lets say a Nike Hoodie) but for much less ($30) that you see in what was typically a department store ($60). They don't have 50 hoodies available per size/color though, they have whatever they could get a hold of (maybe 5 per store). The TJX stores are great place to find good stuff at a better price and it may be a bit dated (like Calphalon stopped making this model pan and makes the exact same one with a different number now, but it is still Calphalon).

Nike Lebron series from 15 to 19 is all worth looking at, loads of cushion and support. Hyperdunk X and Zoom Rize 2, maybe the BB NXT. Not sure exactly what you're looking for in terms of characteristics.

Converse,30/12/2021 05:08:29 AM,hqidnvz,"Ever since I was a little kid, I have always been a huge Converse fan!! I love the look, the style, and how comfortable they are. I used to buy a pair here and there, as my old converse shoes wore out or as I desired to try out a new color. The collection slowly builds up over time that's for sure. Although what really got me into buying &amp; collecting converse was a result of the small &amp; subtle changes the company started making to the shoe about 6 years ago. I didn't like the fact that Nike was starting to make Converse more like Nike, so I started buying up the older versions. The difference between a pair of converse made in 2010 and today is very noticeable!! The two are completely different shoes in everything but overall looks. 

To me, and it helps to own a older pair from the early 2000's, the Chuck '70 is of nearly the same thickness and quality that the regular converse used to be, even just 10 years ago! In fact, I wish they made a premium version of the regular converse that looks like the regular converse. I mean, the Chuck 70 looks amazing and is really comfortable too!!!! I also just want a pair of regular chucks that are made of a good quality like the 70. I'd be willing to pay the difference too.",1,Reddit,nike
technicallythetruth,30/12/2021 05:07:06 AM,hqidibg,"To answer the copy/paste/re-sell question, it's what a NFT's are, which other's have already answered adequately. To re-iterate quickly, NFT's have a unique ID in the form of a ledger on a blockchain (i.e Ethereum), which has a bunch of information, including an easily accessible transaction history. Determining who originally minted the NFT can be found and verified. That information cannot be copied/duplicated.

The value is from NFT's being sold at aftermarket prices. The original sale is a lot more affordable (think retail price on something like a pair of Jordan's), but it's the aftermarket asking price that drives it up due to scarcity (like Nike collabs, X amount made, etc). Tl;dr: Aftermarket/hype pricing

This particular Cthulu NFT that OP linked is a bit more interesting.
It's on an app called VeVe, that releases NFT collectibles in the form of drops created and officially licensed by a bunch of brand names (Disney, Marvel, DC, Cartoon Network, etc.). You can find comics, virtual figures (some with AR features), and some other cool stuff for sale/trade.

Many of the other brands- Nike, Adidas, Four Laps, Beyond Yoga- have huge brand recognition and have been in the athletic wear business for decades. I can justify paying more for these brands. However, Peloton makes a tank top, slaps on their logo and then charges $52. Nope! I will not pay that much for their own line of workout wear.

Anyway, the reality of the situation is that if you want to be a fast distance runner, you also have to be very thin. Emma Coburn, for example, is going to publicly back Mary Cain, and then she‚Äôs going to keep her 5 foot 8 self under 120 pounds because she wants to be competitive.",1,Reddit,nike

MexicoCity,30/12/2021 03:06:38 AM,hqhyhez,"Just a couple precisions:

&amp;#x200B;

* There is no ""subway station"" next to the stadium. You mentioned the ""blue line"" (#2 for further reference), but that one ends at Taxque√±a station. You then need to switch to the ""tren ligero"", which runs on the surface and is considerably smaller and slower than the metro, more like a tram. This is the same transportation that takes you all the way to Xochimilco. It actually underwent extensive maintenance work a couple of years ago and it was out of service for several months.
* There is an official merchandise store but only for Club America stuff, not stadium related stuff (the Nike store you mentioned). That would be more like a ""souvenir"" shop, but given the rather low number of visitors there is (I myself didn't know about that tour until a few years ago when we took a foreign friend there - and I'm an America fan, but I had only been there for the matches) I don't think it would be profitable.

technicallythetruth,30/12/2021 02:53:32 AM,hqhwqmw,"It's a way to prove ownership of a digital item. For instance, if you want to flex how much money you own, you may buy a Rolex or really expensive Nikes. But how do you do that in the metaverse? You buy a RTFKT pair of shoes (now part of Nike) or a BAYC/Crypto Punk. Another example would be some clubs and casinos in the MV require you to own one of their NFTs to get in and participate. Why not just require a regular old username and password? Because the NFTs accomplish the same thing, but with much more transparency (being on the Blockchain). Another example would be traditional basketball cards vs digital basketball cards (NFTs). Some people will never want to switch to a digital version if the collectable, because they need to be able to feel the card...similar to traditional books vs ebooks. They don't care you can hold 250 books on a small device and rent books from your library without ever having to leave your house, they still prefer the physical versions. The NFT version of basketball cards (NBA Top Shot) has the advantages of: 1) you can store thousands digitally on your phone, with access to your entire inventory 24/7. 2) the marketplace is much faster and more efficient (no mailing your cards off to get graded, then waiting for them to grade them and mail them back, then put for sale on ebay, and then mail the cards to the buyer). 3) You know exactly how many were minted, because it's all on the Blockchain. You have no idea how many physical cards were minted. 4) You can see exactly who previously bought your NFT and how much they paid. This allows for better Marketplace analysis. 5) You don't have to worry about your NFTs physically degrading or being destroyed. 6) NFTs generally have much more utility. Top Shot rewards collectors on a daily basis with various contests and challenges. Owners of Phoenix Suns moments were entered into a raffle and the winners received an all expenses paid trip to the finals game in Phoenix with a suite etc. There is also a DFS you can play daily using the Top Shot moments you have with cash prizes of $10,000/week. 7) The Top Shot NFTs aren't a static image. It's an entire play. And you can display your NFTs on digital frames if you're wanting to show them off (like some people do with thier physical collectables). 8) The communities built around some NFTs are amazing. 

They aren't for everyone, but too many people aren't critically thinking enough about them, instead just dismissing them as stupid because that's the popular belief right now (which I understand, because all most people know about NFTs is BAYC and CryptoPunks...but those are a very small percentage of people flexing how much money they have. It's not representative of the NFT community). If you think we are moving to a more digital future, then you might want to at least try some out to see for yourself. If you are into sports, I suggest NBA Top Shot (they have NBA, NFL, and will soon have UFC). If you like gambling, I suggest Gambling Apes. They have just built a casino in the Decentraland Metaverse and give profit sharing to all GA NFT holders (as well as free monthly poker tournaments with crypto prizes). If you are a dad, I suggest CryptoDads. They have a great support group, sell their own energy drinks and whisky, and have IRL meetups all over the U.S. If you are into comics, I suggest VeVe. But there are many other NFTs for a variety of other things. 

All I ask is you give it a try (you don't have to buy anything, just check them out). It's just a superior product, kind of like Netflix vs Blockbuster, IMO. Too many people get hung up on the code being a ""receipt"", but how do you think online banking works...it's all code... NFTs just happen to have more transparency (which could eventually be a negative if you want complete privacy (which makes the argument they are only for money laundering laughable)).",1,Reddit,nike

&gt;""As for the why, some amateur opinions have been floated regarding the material used for Nike‚Äôs new jerseys ‚Äî opinions that suggest the Eagles‚Äô midnight green color code remains the same, and that it merely looks different because of how it reflects on Nike‚Äôs material.  
&gt;  
&gt;When reached for comment on the apparent evolution of greens, a Nike spokesman offered this explanation:  
&gt;The green changed from Sport Teal to Deep Teal for the ‚Äô17 season when they switched into the Vapor Untouchable (from the Elite 51). The sideline apparel was always Deep Teal and was the closest to an ‚ÄúEagles‚Äù green. We took the opportunity of the uniform changeover to make all the greens consistent.""

Yes, it changed from the 2017 season. _That is not what I am fucking talking about whatsoever nor was it my claim_. Idk how I can make that any clearer. I am talking about the change that took place pre 2014 season. Before said fabric change, Nike had the color exactly right in the first two seasons post Nike takeover.

no you got it wrong my friend, not everything is about yerevan.. you havent looked past yerevan, thats your problem.

&gt; they stole money from our soldiers
Bullshit, our soldiers havent seen better days since Pashik took power, give me one area of the life of a soldier that was improved when Pashik took power and show me exact figures or facts that prove stealing from the military.. You cant, because its pure garbage, this coming from someone who is family and or connected to all previous ministers of defence of Artsakh, I know very well how our soldiers are now compared to before, you dont need to tell me. Our soldiers were forced to fight in fucking nike sneakers because we didnt even have enough proper boots delivered. 

&gt; our soliders didnt even have proper weapons

Another baseless fact, you are just parroting off of facebook media, Armenia had sufficient enough weapons to hold the ambush for much longer, the reason we lost the war is because your clown of a ""best leader of armenia"" decided he wanted Lele tepe back so that he can say he did better than Serj, thats when we lost most of our fire power, when they decided to move 4 tank battalions and attack before they even got there because Pashik ordered it so the guys got fucking slaughtered by walking into an ambush, because the attack was ordered before the full transfer was completed. 

The only aread we lacked was proper air defence against drones, and guess what plans were set after the 2016 4 day war to order TOR and OSA systems, because we saw how effective the isreali drones were even then, your clown scrapped those plans when he took office and bought the SUs instead which didnt even fly during the war.

&gt; the corrupt bastards took apart and sold the railroads and because of that, Armenia now needs to pay 200+ million dollars to replace them

No, Armenia now needs to pay 200+ because your clown is opening those railroads with Azerbaijan meanwhile they are still 3km inside our border, because he is busy licking alyievs boots because of trade routes. What good will those do to Armenia now when we have no bargening chip, you think turks will just become our brotherly nation and let us freely use trains through their terretory? you can forget that dont be naive. 

&gt; look at what Szerh did, he fucking tried to pull a putin and remain in power for as long as he wanted and even threatened the people of the country with March 2

look at what Nikol is doing now, mass protest detaines, freedom of speech is at a 0, you insult him you get fined millions, police beating protestors on the streets and locking them up.. wow very democratic.

&gt; we need to build buildings for the people so they could live there

*sell peoples homes to enemy -&gt; build new homes -&gt; sell new homes to those refugees -&gt; profit* fantastic..

&gt;  it's a country that is growing 

actually its the opposite, the country has only shrunk during his time in power both figurativly and literally.

&gt; they are actually using it for the military and its slowly changing, our military budget has increased greatly ever since he came into power

Bullshit again, our millitary budget is larger now because we are at 0 right now ofc the spending is gonna be bigger, thats common sense, they have to rebuy everything that was assembled through 30 years before him, but again, show who stole what and how much, because you are just  parroting his populist statements without any facts. and even IF they DID steal, at least they stole but our borders were safe, you cant say that about pashik.

Everything youve said here just shows you are one of those who have fallen for bullshit populistic speeches. By any standard Pashinyan is by far the worst leader in modern armenian history, and its not even fucking close. 

Again the country hasnt advanced in a single area since his time in power, not one. Economy is worse than during Kochs time, military is worse than Serjes time.

so its natural for Nike to want to somewhat fully control the image of a player as big as Haaland, and be able to promote him as interconnected with Barcelona, it opens doors for further advertising, including him in commercial material, promotional events and stuff like that, all under the Nike conglomerate umbrella, making Haaland the be all end all ambassador for Nike football alongside Barcelona


Then theres the whole thing about image rights and contractial obligations which i know very little about so cant speak on it, basically theres a lot of money in this sort of stuff with these type of players, its why there were reports that Chelsea wanted Messi


Its all about brand consistency, its certainly not the be all end all, and its why there are so many example of brands clashing with clubs and players, but depending on how big Nike is in on Haaland, Barca could use that as leverage in negotiations, not to mention Nike could provide conditional bonuses to Haaland to play for their biggest club


Im not gonna act like im some sort of expert on this btw, im mostly regurgitating information ive gathered over the years from people much more knowledgeable on this, but there are hundreds of millions of euros in worldwide marketing potential here for Nike, it HAS to be a factor, how big or how small is up for interpretation",1,Reddit,nike

Yep, a very dark irony considering who the clients for said cotton are (Nike, etc).

&gt;America at least isn't engaging in an active and systematic erasure of a culture and ethnic identity, 

I know being pedantic looks a little disgusting in such subjects, but neither is China. What they are nominally trying to do is religious, not ethnic or relating to cultural identity. 

They hope to use Mao's Red Book reeducate Allah out of a million or so rebellious sunni Muslims with religious beliefs of the more fundamental variety. In other words ""believe what you wish as long as the earthly authority of the CCP is respected above all"". 

Of course, all of that doesn't excuse what they are doing in any way, or have a hope in hell of working, but not the same thing either.

The 15 other million Uighury are indeed living perfectly fine in modern cities, in a modern way, with their identity, culture, language and minority rights respected, including in schools. 

On a separate note, it should also be noted that this rebellion really got reactivated after a 50 year pause when around 15'000 Uyghur ISIS fighters were flown back by Turkey (reportedly with the UK's blessing) to neighbouring Kirghizstan and Tadjikistan.",1,Reddit,nike

1. There is now an easily synthesized material that can directly transform heat into electricity. 
2. There is now a substance that can be grown and which can be used to make a battery with ninety plus percent efficiency. 
3. There are now a series of indestructible cables, circling the Equator, connected to massive asteroids in geosynchronous orbit above the earth with space elevators attached. 
4. There are receivers on earth designed to capture a new form of electromagnetic radiation.
5. There are massive solar arrays in space capable of capturing both light and solar particles and transforming them into a form of electromagnetic radiation which does not interact with any matter but the ones used in the receivers from 4.
6. Plans are released for a simple device that can take a persons broadcasted words, TV, Radio, Internet, etc. and block any that are untrue. 
7. Politicians plans to make the devices, from 6, illegal; fail when it is shown that nobody who has such a device can hear their justification for making them illegal. 
8. There is now several space stations orbiting the Sun. Each one with interior generic platform style docking bays and an energy field over the entrance which prevents any uncontained gas, natural object (for example meteors), or radiation from entering. Each one has a habitat replicating one of the natural environments on Earth and are populated with a selection of animals native to those habitats.
9. I now have a bank account incapible of dropping below 12 digits.

centrist,29/12/2021 10:57:56 PM,hqh00yn,"&gt;And the point I'm making is that when Biden DID do something for ostensibly altruistic reasons you called it ""lip service"" and doubted that it was actually altruistic at all.

We're not getting anywhere, and you're contradicting yourself. You want to have your cake and eat it too. ""Ostensibly altruistic reasons"" but no politician does things for altruistic reasons. 

&gt;I'm defending that Biden not forcing the whole country to do anything and everything in pursuit of this goal isn't a sin. 

That's a strawman. ""Anything and everything."" I'm not saying he start WWIII either.

&gt;It's perfectly OK for him to use diplomatic pressure to try and stop China from doing this and if Americans undermine his efforts in other ways that's not a failing of Biden.

Or he and/or his party could put pressure on these American companies who do business with China. There's a variety of things that can be implemented. When politicians pay lip service or do nothing at all, people are quick to defend it by saying we can't rock the boat, we can't get these countries mad at us, think about the economy.

But then when these politicians do something that significantly affects the country, diplomatic relations, and the economy in negative ways, then it's argued that it was necessary, we had no choice, it was the right thing to do, etc.

&gt;Not really, no. I can recommend a few sources that help explain exactly why it's not warranted, if you're interested. You're literally trying to prove your point by saying it's wrong for politicians consider what their constituents want out of them and that's not something I will accept as reasonable criticism.

No, that's not what I'm saying at all. Yes, politicians consider what their constituents want out of them that they can get their votes and get re-elected to continue making themselves wealthy as members of congress. They also consider what their corporate donors want out of them, what their party wants out of them, and other factors that provide a variety of conflicts of interest.

I used the example of the Iraq War vote, and you're arguing that it was simply because that's what their constituents wanted? You bring up later that's how a democracy works, but we're a democratic *republic*. So it's not simply, the majority gets what they want. 

I've noticed that you avoided discussing that infamous vote. 

&gt;Well yeah, duh, that's how democracy is SUPPOSED to work. No system is perfect. Obviously if we tie public policy to popular opinion then that sword cuts both ways. Duh. But to criticize politicians for that is naive and harmful. The output is the product of the input. Get mad at the input, which in this case is the voter.

Democracy is more akin ruling by majority, or more specifically direct democracy. We have something a little different, which we just like to call ""democracy"" in general. And this is like the third strawman you've made. I never said any system is perfect. And you're also moving the goal post. I'm criticizing Biden's voting record, and how he voted for the wrong things for very wrong reasons and you come back with, ""duh, that's how democracy is SUPPOSED to work!""

*Hey, members of congress voted against a law that would have prevented them from engaging in corrupt activities and financially benefiting from said corrupt activities. That's wrong.* 

""Duh, that's how democracy works!""

It's  not naive nor harmful to rightfully criticize and point out politicians who will send us to war that results in thousands of our soldiers dead, and hundreds of thousands Iraqi citizens killed,  just to keep their seat in the senate. I guess for you that's business as usual. It was more important that these politicians look tough on terrorism, than do the right and logical thing.

&gt;YOU do. And that's perfectly reasonable. But there's one thing you're not considering here. ""China shouldn't have concentration camps"" is a different issue than ""Americans shouldn't support anything from China because of concentration camps."" 

I never said that either. So another strawman.

&gt;Yes. Maybe you should watch less Fox News. Conservative politicians were happy to encourage folks to boycott Nike during the Colin Kaepernick situation.

Oh, okay. So I was correct, that there were no boycotts of Nike for them using Chinese slave labor. 

And I see the disconnect between us. You're assuming that I'm a conservative who watches Fox News and maybe OANN, Newsmax, etc. I don't. I've been a critic of Fox News since the O'Reilly days back in the early 2000s. You're basing this whole discussion on some erroneous assumptions. 

&gt;That was after just like two minutes of googling.

I'm obviously talking about Nike using slaves, not some right/left, red/blue politics. 

So neither conservatives in this case, nor liberals/progressives are willing to engage in widespread boycotts over Nike using slave labor. But Nike giving Kaep an endorsement deal? That's where we draw the line!

&gt;\&gt; How was Chick-Fil-A engaging in human rights abuses?  
&gt;  
&gt;Not weighing in on whether they were or not. The point is folks who were boycotting Chick-Fil-A felt that their anti-gay stance was a human rights abuse.

That's a stretch if they're making that claim, and my point is that there are folks who will boycott Chick-Fil-A, which according to you, ""affects their standard of living"" as if they were the only fast food establishment in the U.S. because it *donated* to a foundation that opposes same-sex marriage. Nike uses literal slave labor and there's no push by these same people to boycott Nike.

If you don't see the hypocrisy of that, I don't know what to tell you.

&gt;Cool, so then my original comments trying to distinguish between Biden the general public were spot on.

No, the general public involves everyone, voters and politicians. 

&gt;I guess, but not really the point. 

It is since you made the argument that not buying high-priced Nike products or purchasing bad-for-your-health Coca-Cola bottles is going to negatively affect people's standard of living. 

&gt;The point is that folks can want China to stop doing slavery stuff but also not be willing to change their own behaviors to harm folks who use slavery stuff. 

But you just posted two examples of people willing to change their own behaviors in regards to Nike and Kaepernick and Chick-Fil-A. 

&gt;I agree that's worthy of criticism, but then you should criticize voters, not whine about politicians and ""lip service.""

Sorry, but it's healthy, normal, and necessary to both be skeptical of our elected officials as well as critical of them. If you want to play the role of the Biden Admin's spokesperson, you have that right. But it doesn't make sense for you to get upset when people voice criticism or skepticism of politicians who have questionable track records.

&gt;I mean, thinking of politics at all in a moral sense doesn't make a lot of sense. 

You just said earlier that Biden possibly did this for altruistic reasons. You want to have your cake and eat it too. 

&gt;You'd benefit a lot from reading some comparative politics. I'd be happy to recommend a source or two to get you started.

Sure. But how would that be necessary for this particular discussion when you've ignored the relevant points I've made regarding the politics in this country, and the voting records of the president we're discussing? 

&gt;True, I guess you did contradict your original point by saying the exact opposite.

If you're going out of your way to be condescending just to admit you either didn't read the entirety of my original comment, which wasn't very long, or you were purposely ignoring it just to argue.",1,Reddit,nike

centrist,29/12/2021 09:46:27 PM,hqgpasm,"\&gt; No. That was in response to you saying ""of course people in politics don't do things for altruistic reasons. Why should they?""

And the point I'm making is that when Biden DID do something for ostensibly altruistic reasons you called it ""lip service"" and doubted that it was actually altruistic at all. 

\&gt; I never said it was his duty to right every wrong in the world. But what I'm arguing that this is, and what you seem to be defending, is machiavellianism.

I'm defending that Biden not forcing the whole country to do anything and everything in pursuit of this goal isn't a sin. It's perfectly OK for him to use diplomatic pressure to try and stop China from doing this and if Americans undermine his efforts in other ways that's not a failing of Biden.

\&gt; I think it's warranted considering the track record of many politicians, if not most.

Not really, no. I can recommend a few sources that help explain exactly why it's not warranted, if you're interested. You're literally trying to prove your point by saying it's wrong for politicians consider what their constituents want out of them and that's not something I will accept as reasonable criticism.

\&gt; Often times, if it benefits politicians to do good, they'll do good. If it benefits them to support bad things, they'll support bad things.

Well yeah, duh, that's how democracy is SUPPOSED to work. No system is perfect. Obviously if we tie public policy to popular opinion then that sword cuts both ways. Duh. But to criticize politicians for that is naive and harmful. The output is the product of the input. Get mad at the input, which in this case is the voter.

\&gt; I think when it comes to outright enslavement, it would make a difference.

YOU do. And that's perfectly reasonable. But there's one thing you're not considering here. ""China shouldn't have concentration camps"" is a different issue than ""Americans shouldn't support anything from China because of concentration camps."" You're treating these as identical because you're on the same side for both issues, and that's perfectly fine, but it's not unreasonable for folks to have different views on each of these.

\&gt; By who? Were politicians getting involved?

Yes. Maybe you should watch less Fox News. Conservative politicians were happy to encourage folks to boycott Nike during the Colin Kaepernick situation.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nike-kaepernick/trump-targets-nike-as-kaepernick-ads-spark-boycott-calls-idUSKCN1LL1WS](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nike-kaepernick/trump-targets-nike-as-kaepernick-ads-spark-boycott-calls-idUSKCN1LL1WS)

[https://time.com/5392327/kenner-louisiana-boycott-nike/](https://time.com/5392327/kenner-louisiana-boycott-nike/)

That was after just like two minutes of googling.

\&gt; How was Chick-Fil-A engaging in human rights abuses?

Not weighing in on whether they were or not. The point is folks who were boycotting Chick-Fil-A felt that their anti-gay stance was a human rights abuse.

\&gt; It doesn't. My comment about ""putting your money where your mouth is"" was more towards the public in general.

Cool, so then my original comments trying to distinguish between Biden the general public were spot on.

\&gt; Doing any variation of this is not going to harm or affect my standard of living.

I guess, but not really the point. The point is that folks can want China to stop doing slavery stuff but also not be willing to change their own behaviors to harm folks who use slavery stuff. I agree that's worthy of criticism, but then you should criticize voters, not whine about politicians and ""lip service.""

\&gt; But I'm not going to assume it's because they just wanted to do something good.

I mean, thinking of politics at all in a moral sense doesn't make a lot of sense. You'd benefit a lot from reading some comparative politics. I'd be happy to recommend a source or two to get you started.

\&gt; I changed that up at the end of that same post though, where I said, if it at least brings awareness to the issue, I'll give Biden credit for that.

EngineeringResumes,29/12/2021 08:18:19 PM,hqgbkbn,"&gt;For discipline; it‚Äôs going through the disciplinary process at ups from verbal warning all the way to firing Recognition: is the issuing of awards/ gifts I‚Äôm not sure how I would word that differently

You may want to leave the disciplinary part out as you'll likely not need to fire people as an entry-level engineer. 

&gt;I don‚Äôt think I can elaborate on that as an assistant I was really only allowed to fabricate the straight edge stuff

OK, but you could at least tell us if you cut granite for bathrooms and kitchens. Something that shows you won't be a hazard to yourself. 

&gt;Your on the right track, but how do I keep that sentence from being a parts list vs aiding my goal. From memory, I used a 12s4p li battery and 2 dual brushless motors. I feel like that would convolute the line.

That's all you need to say. You don't need to mention ""I used 5x M6x1.00 screws to hold a McMaster-Carr ABC123 motor in place"" level of detail, just a high-level ""battery powering two brushless motors"" like what you've just told me will suffice. When *Car and Driver* talks about a car, they usually start &amp; stop at something like ""200-horsepower V6 mated to a six-speed manual driving the rear wheels"". It just needs to fill in that gap so the reader can get an idea of the ""how"" the sausage is made. 


&gt;Documentation on succes vs fail is non existent.. I guess that‚Äôs a mistake I made when undertaking this home project but I think it be fair to say failure is drop by 30%, with that be an acceptable claim?

That's fine, you don't need hard published numbers for everything. Just a casual observation is fine, like you noticed you could make parts with fewer finishing operations or rejected fewer items. You said you could see an increase in accuracy, so surely you noticed something. 

&gt;The project failed only because it was part of the project to be loaded to its failure point , but I got a passing grade because it met the minimum load required. Might just be a poor choice of words in this case.

Yes, definitely reword it to say it met the loading criteria of whatever pounds. You don't want to make it seem like you failed this project. ‚Äã

&gt;I might be blanking on this one since I definitely learn as needed and sometimes I don‚Äôt revisit those skills unless needed. Can you give some examples so I work off of those ?

Things like programming, CAD, machining, composites. Skills that you have learned, can theoretically demonstrate if called upon even if you have to do a bit of refreshing, and you can't bullshit your way out of them. If I ask you to cut some material or drill a half-inch clearance hole, you either know or don't know how.

&gt;As for certain ‚Äúhard skill‚Äù I‚Äôm failing on naming them I guess. I can use a band saw or a drill press, I can trouble shoot a circuit board to see why certain features aren‚Äôt working, I can edit existing code using the provide documentation, I do daily quality inspection on repairs and machines. Now it‚Äôs dawning to me how I can use some of these to expand on my projects/work experience but how do I make some of these into one or two word skills that is an accurate representation

I mean ""machining"" will suffice for most centers, ""C++/C\#/whatever languages you know"", ""carbon fiber fabrication"" are examples of things you could put down. The job description will usually mention skills that you hopefully already know. That's also a good place to start assuming you actually know these skills. 

&gt;I feel conflicted about this one, your comment is pushing me to get rid of at least one. The big part about this is that it dictated a lot of my time in college. I thought it was an important point to help highlight how much I was able to do with all of the responsibilities I held. An example of this was my typical M-F was booked with activities from 6am to 11:30 pm. Is there‚Äôs a more appropriate place to highlight my dedication to my responsibilities?

It's great, but at two bullets a piece and four bullets + headers total, it's already equal to your work cutting granite and eating up space for whatever you potentially did with ASME club, things that could actually get you hired depending on what the job is looking for. As I said, this isn't a college application, unless this is a job with Nike or Umbro or similar, there needs to be an engineering or leadership argument for what you're doing. Charity work and fundraising is great, but if the other candidate has five years doing CNC machining and helped built a light aircraft, it's not really going to make a case for you. Ultimately you chose to do these sports and my hat's off to you for managing to balance all that.

I think it's worth heading into the Nike store to try out both on the treadmill, or if that option isn't available, to order both and see which one works best. I haven't taken my Vaporfly past 13.1ish miles, but it worked great for that run (a half marathon a few weeks ago).

GMEJungle,29/12/2021 06:55:18 PM,hqfyphc,"Not necessarily related to your question but I found some interesting news about WealthSimple recently.

I was researching an unrelated topic (‚Äúwho owns The Canadian Press?‚Äù) and came across The Power Corporation of Canada, a multi MULTI billion-dollar holding company that primarily deals with the financial sector (investments, insurance, asset management, etc.). They brought in $64 billion in revenue in 2020 (almost more than Nike and McDonald‚Äôs combined!!) so these guys are fucking huge.

I was curious so I looked into their latest quarterly report and found that a handful of their subsidiaries (Portage, Power Financial and IGM, collectively operating as Fintech Investments) acquired a huge chunk of ownership in WealthSimple in 2021 (over 40% after dilution from a round of funding).

It‚Äôs found on Page 20 of the PDF, Page 16 of the actual document here:
https://www.powercorporation.com/media/uploads/reports/quarter/pcc-2021-q3-web-eng_lRRA4Ku.pdf

I was wondering if there are any wrinklies out there who know how to research into these companies to determine whether or not they have any exposure to GME (13F style filings, any disclosures, etc.)

Some names of interest are:

- Portage 
- Power Financial
- IGM (IG Wealth Management, Mackenzie, Northleaf)
- Meritech Capital
- Greylock Partners

It may be nothing but it‚Äôs well within reason - given all the shit that apes uncovered this year - to question whether or not something more nefarious may be at play.

trackandfield,29/12/2021 06:43:51 PM,hqfwwma,"Yeah I mean at the end of the day your body is going to change as you grow, and the only thing you really want to avoid is being too heavy or too light until your body type settles a bit. You don't really seem in danger of either here but focussing on losing weight alone as a way to get faster puts you in danger of being underweight. While it might not seem like a huge deal, less weight means less muscle which means your joints will have less support too.  


Ultimately if you focus on eating well and your training, you'll lose any extra weight you may have while also increasing your strength and endurance. If you focus on losing weight alone, you'll likely lose some of your current strength and endurance in the process.

decentraland,29/12/2021 06:38:06 PM,hqfw0b7,"Not going to sugar coat this, but your take on this is exactly what I wanted to hear. Just wasn‚Äôt sure of how it would likely pan out. You seem pretty sure and I hope this comes to fruition. 

MANA was my first investment back in February and when I first read about the project I imagined household names, companies and celebrities purchasing land and using it to market their brand and host events. 

I also imagined it getting a slice of Hollywood in the sense that you could go watch a blockbuster at a virtual AMC with your friends from the comfort of your own home. Same with sporting and music events. 

I envisioned in time you could stick a VR headset on and go buy a pair of trainers from a virtual Nike or Adidas store and have them delivered to your home in the real world. 

I‚Äôve seen a few snippets of these visions in the game but DCL has surprised me so far by appearing to go down the NFT road. 

I still believe in the project massively but I‚Äôd like to see a lot more of the above happening before I actually download the game and I feel like this maybe the current reason as to why the daily users are so low. 

At the moment it doesn‚Äôt have that mainstream ‚Äòpull‚Äô. 

Hope things develop in time but I will be staying for the long term regardless.",1,Reddit,nike

Sometimes there is a somewhat valid desire to raise awareness or make a political point.  The idea is, for example, that wearing a pro-LGBTQ shirt will help to normalize support, and make it seem like more of a normal thing, if people are confident in making their support obvious and public.

However, there are a lot of Americans who really base their identity on support for a sports team, a political party, their religion, their race, or even a consumer brand.  As in, if you were to ask them about themselves, they might say the most important thing to know is that they‚Äôre a Steelers fan.  Or that they‚Äôre a Republican.  I knew a guy who pretty much every article of clothing he wore was from Nike.

I‚Äôm not sure how to explain it, but I think it‚Äôs related to the fact that Americans have generally rejected the idea of family and community.  It‚Äôs every man for himself.  But then on an instinctual level, we still want to belong to some kind of group.  We like tribalism.

bangalore,29/12/2021 04:31:54 PM,hqfcbn9,"&gt; Apple hires them to produce and assemble their electronics. 

Apple to Nike all outsource to China, because it's cheap to do there and that's why there's so much criticism on Tim Cook and everyone for enabling ""sweat shop"" working, because workers are made to work in extremely unfair conditions.

&gt; And tbh idk where that ‚Äúchina quality‚Äù phrase came from, almost every high quality part or item, be it a mobile or a car part among others, is manufactured by them.

Yes, everyone is aware that every electronic item comes from China. But here's the difference. You get what you pay for. These companies (ex:Apple) have higher quality standards and hence you get that quality.

But generally any China item that you use has poor quality. If you noticed from childhood, almost anything you use is imported and made in china item. Even something as simple as torch light, to today's mosquito bat. They all last from anywhere between a week to a month. 

Before the advent of smartphones, markets used to have these blaring speaker phones (2007-2010 times) called China phones. Brands like Gionee, etc. The phones were poor quality and won't last more than a year. Even after advent of Android smartphones and before brands like Oneplus entered, the bulk market share was brands like Micromax etc, who imported from China and was re-branding and selling. The phone quality was just poor quality.

From here only comes the ""China quality"", because their generic stuff is genuinely poor. The good ones are from foreign brands, who expect a good quality and pay for it and get the quality.

&gt; that shows in their infrastructure and other stuff.

One of their reasons for what they have achieved is due to the communist governance. All infra gets done and moved because, projects decided today, starts getting executed tomorrow.

No opposition/protests for anything. Whether be it land acquisition, environmental clearance, everything will go through without any hindrance, because there's no one to question all that.

running,29/12/2021 04:09:17 PM,hqf8xzd,"&gt;Now, I‚Äôm a cheaper fuck.  
&gt;  
&gt;So for anyone else that was/is in my position, are high-quality running shoes worth it for a casual runner?

I am also quite cheap. I only ever bought shoes at Wal Mart and wore them until they fell apart. This was until my early 30's.

I bought $70 athletic shoes from a Nike store when I started running. They were not running shoes and I got runner's knee within a week. That's when I started buying proper running shoes, which cost between $120-$180.

Look, hobbies cost money and it's ok to spend on them. Running is rather cheap since the shoes are the only expensive component that you NEED. Given your flat feet, you're going to need something like the Brooks Beast, and you won't have very many options either. And if you're thinking of purchasing a 4-year old version of that shoe on amazon, then save yourself the effort. The support breaks down as a function of time and you will end up either getting hurt or replacing them faster.

Oh, and you will still have problems. Shin splints is super common and usually (but not always) caused by glute weaknesses. You may need a trip to the PT to get the information you need to sort it out, plus the time to strengthen up weaknesses. All of this is NORMAL! You just don't hear about it so much.",1,Reddit,nike

Just adding a short pitch here (not financial advice): Foot Locker has been dropping after the last quarter earnings release, apparently due to inventory concerns and missing same-store sales estimates. Retail names also in general have been going down likely due to Omicron and post-Covid performance concerns. Foot Locker in particular also has gone down back to 2019 levels, likely due to a somewhat valid concern that the business model is outdated, and there is always that perpetual worry that Nike will pull out. 

To just address the Nike concern -- I don't think this will happen for a long time, if it ever happens. Nike DTC sales are stalling a bit, and even though Nike is trying to decrease it's wholesale partners, Nike has clearly stated that it views Foot Locker as a long-term strategic partner. At least for the foreseeable future, the advantages that Foot Locker provides to Nike are greater than the negatives. 

As of TODAY, Footlocker is firing on all cylinders. It's doing great. And it's trading at around a \~6.5X P/E and a \~8.7X P/FCF multiple, and this doesn't take into consideration (i) the 440 mm in net cash (after taking into consideration the 350 mm paid for the Atmos acquisition); and the (ii) \~600-700mm ""hidden"" asset they have in [GOAT.com](https://GOAT.com). If you adjust the market cap by taking out the [GOAT.com](https://GOAT.com) asset, you have an even lower adjusted P/E value of 5.45 with a net cash of 440 mm. 

The Foot Locker investment could work out just by another re-rating of the [GOAT.com](https://GOAT.com) investment. Even if it doesn't the current business is being valued cheaply enough that there's a very safe equity cushion. I'm looking forward to the [GOAT.com](https://GOAT.com) investment and also the Atmos acquisition -- given the inflationary trends the reseller/premium/collectibles market is likely going to stay strong and both brands have a good chance of becoming bigger names.

running,29/12/2021 03:23:29 PM,hqf2fbw,"I am now a casual runner, running 0-7 days per week, averaging 0-30 miles per week, but I was once less than casual, sometimes running 100 miles per week. A few years ago, I would have said that it didn't make that much of a difference, but over the past few years there have been some huge advances in midsole foam technology. The lower end shoes, intended for casual use, typically don't have the same foam as the ""real"" running shoes. So for instance, a low-end Nike like the Downshifter, still uses EVA foam, whereas their upper end shoes now use React or ZoomX foam. It's a big difference. So not only could one argue that the more expensive shoes might be better at preventing injury, but I can say with all certainty that the ones with the upgraded foam are just more enjoyable to run in.

Except for left-wing movements in America we ended fascism, largely ended communism and socialism is defeating itself...

The world should be glad there is a well-intended watchdog... Before Joe biden's huge blunder in Afghanistan we kept Muslim terrorists in leadership on a leash around the world... Minus the Obama payoff to Iran...  Trump took out a high-level government official terrorist in Iran...

We have prevented Israel from being taken over even beyond their own amazing self-defense...

With stronger leadership we might help save Taiwan and Hong Kong... Ukraine is looking ripe for the picking...

I can't think of a better large powerful nation to spread its wings around the world... Definitely not China, definitely not Russia... The European Union is weak and disarms its own people... I'm glad for Brexit...

As long as America has a strong military, that we should start using at our border, the world won't have to worry about any other powerful leader trying to take over the world or more than a few neighbors next door...

North Korea won't take over South Korea

Japan won't have another one of their greater East Asian co prosperity spheres (murderous empire)

Mao won't be replaced with another Mao

Fascism in Europe was pushed into Spain that was neutral during the war anyway

The Cold War was victorious for freedom and capitalism, sadly Russia is still dysfunctional with a post-Soviet KGB run black market economy... But at least they're satellites have improved outside the USSR hegemony post-cold war...

We may have lost against communism in Vietnam but they have made great economic and capitalist investments going from bicycles to scooters to cars... Nike factories... I'm doing much better than under Mongol rule or Chinese rule... They quite frankly missed the boat when it comes to the French and the Americans... Then they adopt Western ways anyway because they have to become economically viable...

We have helped overthrow several dictators even after supporting some of them in previous administrations!  Saddam Hussein comes to mind...

If you have some disturbed left-wing moral failing you will look at these American efforts as just a big bully situation when in fact Saddam Hussein and his two sons richly deserved death... ISIS deserved conquering and even the Taliban had problems with them!

Hope you can appreciate what we did against Noriega in Panama

We saved South Korea, Maybe you can look at a nightmap of the world, look at the difference between North and South Korea...

We saved Kuwait from Saddam Hussein...

We have picked off several Somali pirates...

We have never won the drug war and prohibition didn't work...  But then again like with Vietnam (police action relative to the full force of American military) we haven't had a congressional declaration of war which is a 100% certain victory as the war powers act unleashes the military with full authority for whoever got declared war on!  Last time that happened was against Japan and Germany... Didn't go so well for them...

To have a country with well over 100 bases around the world and the greatest military presence by far and not be imperialistic and conquer lands is unique and distinct in human history... 

You may try to argue we are in a Thucydides's trap with hegemons competing But even with the current brinksmanship China has largely had a non-imperial policy with Tibet as a huge exception... After Han unification they haven't done much and if anything were subjugated by Britannia and Japan later on and even more so by their horrible greatest killer of all time Communist leader Mao

America is a profoundly positive influence in world history... I would argue we deserve to have the biggest and best military, sadly it may be used next against state by state secession movements before any wide global conflict or World War III...",1,Reddit,nike

Unfortunately, I feel like its not very realistic to think Nike or Adidas have much interest yet. Maybe in the next couple of years outdoor brands like The North Face or Patagonia will find value in the sport and its players and start investing. 

But as things are right now players are at a bit of disadvantage and still very reliant on the disc manufacturers.

Teachers are already paid higher than the supply/demand price point. That wage is held there by government only hiring union teachers. Likewise, you cannot hire a low wage  Chinese housekeeper as the government is prohibiting you from letting them in to the country. Physicians (like me) are paid at higher rates than supply/demand because of government prohibitions on non-licensed prescriptions.

The world *was* becoming a free and open market. That was known as globalization, which is what allowed Apple to have products built in China, and Nike in Indonesia.

[I commented on COIN earlier. My largest holdings are BOX and GoDaddy. They were great values before they popped 10-15% but still good long term potential   GoDaddy holds 60%+ market share in webhosting. It has consistent ARPU growth and is a great platform to continue to add value added services to drive revenue growth. Currently expanding into CC transaction and B&amp;M POS (good for omnichannel customers). Could get to $150+ over the next 2-3 years if they can execute well on strategy. Good cash flow as well with steady growth.  Box... This one is my baby. Cloud based file management solution. Another platform play with good capabilities in adding value added services to drive revenue retention. Recently added digital signature to their offering which is big for their financial customers. This helped drive an uptick of +600 bps in revenue retention. Largest competitors are Dropbox, Google drive, OneDrive and on-prem solutions. Have had experience with all of these and Box is the most superior in my experience. Management focus in driving margin expansion and recently just became profitable. Conservative PT of $31 but think this can go to $35ish if they show strong execution on strategy the next couple quarters.  Ironically, my holdings are big Starboard Value investments. SB failed an activist campaign on Box and sold 70% of their holdings afterwards.

It‚Äôs legitimately their long game.   Zuckerberg sees the current mobile environment dominated by Google and Apple as a risk for Facebook which it is. To him the next progression from mobile is to AR/VR and the quicker the transition happens the better it is for FB.   Think of how Google and Apple are to the mobile internet. You wouldn‚Äôt say Google owns the mobile internet but they do own the platform through which most of us interact with it as well as key apps that we use in it.   That‚Äôs what FBs long game is for AR/VR. To own the platform that allow us to interact with it, keys apps within it, and the hardware we use to access it. To be for AR/VR what Google/Apple for mobile and what Microsoft was for computers.   The desire to front run everyone is because the faster the transition occurs the faster FB can move away from the shadow of Google and Apple and the risk that carries. Whether or not he‚Äôs right about VR/AR is to be seen but he‚Äôs got a track record of success.](/r/stocks/comments/rql9cs/what_are_your_top_picks_for_a_metaverse_portfolio/hqbfi0i/)

Then I would set alerts at prices that were 1% higher than the previous price for somewhere between a 10-20% upside move, and then when the alerts were triggered I would look at the setup and trade it (or not), set a 1% stop loss or wider depending on volatility and if I only used cash.

V is working with financial institutions to make deals that will eventually accept crypto.   On the bearish side of things, there are rumors of regulatory crackdown on V for shady backroom, monopolistic practices. Rumors that they worked with PYPL and SQ in a way to squeeze out competition. Also on the bear side, that AMZN is removing Visa from prime purchases in Europe.

[Stocks have risks, and the 2020-2021 bull rip diluted perceptions of risk, and that the traditional advice that‚Äôs existed for decades around understanding your risk profile and diversifying to invest accordingly were actually a long-term accurate strategy.  I‚Äôm convinced that people are over-invested and not nearly as risk-tolerant as they want to think they are, and that‚Äôs playing a large role in the current pain. A portfolio should really only have a small amount of gambles and a large amount of bogleheads-style holdings.  For example, if I add every speculative position I hold together, it‚Äôs not even ~~40%~~ 30% of what I have in AAPL alone. I see portfolio examples here that honestly blow my mind with how risky they are.

[The entire difference between Cathie Wood and Warren Buffett this year (ARKK vs BRK.B/BRK.A) is that Wood trimmed TSLA to reduce its percentage of holdings and ended up putting the TSLA gains to losing plays, while Buffett just kept his AAPL and let it keep growing regardless of how big it's gotten (their AAPL stake now accounts for near 50% of BRK.A's entire equities portfolio).  ARKK should've just followed Buffett's lead and become a quasi TSLA tracking company like how BRK.A/B track AAPL + big banks.  TSLA should be like 20-25% of ARKK... not 8.4% which it would be if they'd kept their 3-4 million shares instead of trimming all the way down to 1.3 million.  AAPL shares account for around 20-25% of BRK.A/BRK.B's entire market cap.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rqpki7/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_december_29_2021/hqcd2dz/)

[&gt;So apple traded 5% returns based purely on earnings when bonds paid 3%, today it trades at 3.3% vs 1.5‚Ä¶. So it had a 2% spread then and a 1.8% spread now. That‚Äôs without factoring in earnings growth rates.     u/Olorin_1990 Thanks for your comment. I've never compared relative spreads. Just so I understand. 2% spread came from AAPL paying 5% shareholder yield versus T-bonds paying 3%, yeah?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;it‚Äôs priced to give with reasonable projections 2.5-4% annualized returns without capital loss/gains factored in, not much is paying that well safely right now.  I suppose even if there is a 10% drop in the near term, you would still make 2.5-4% over the next X years, and it's not unreasonable to expect AAPL to regain the 10% market-cap drop over X years, netting you just the returns with no capital loss.   Nice.  The problem then is not a near term 10% drop but AAPL as a company going to shit.](/r/stocks/comments/rqxfj8/the_biggest_difference_between_19982000_and/hqdu3cs/)

Nike rhymes with ""spiky"". 

Nike chairman Philip Knight has confirmed the correct way to pronounce the brand's name, after two men sent him a letter asking him to circle either ""Ni-ke"" or ""Ni-key"" and answer what they called ""one of life's big unanswered questions"".

Nike was named after the Greek goddess of victory, Nike.

Classical Greek names ending in -e in English are pronounced as an -ee, they are not silent. Nike has the -e pronounced, for the same reason that Hermione, Danae, and Zoe do. As do Aphrodite, Circe, Hecate, Persephone, Phoebe, Psyche, and Selene.

Nike was created in the US, and the people who created it knew who Nike was, and how she is pronounced in English.",1,Reddit,nike

[I doesn't matter how great or innovative the company is, as long as the CCP looks overhead there will never be good investments in China. These companies bring additional risk for the same amount of profit you would get by researching and investing in US companies.  The reason people want to invest in CCP stocks so much is because they thought that BABA would be the next Amazon and they would become billionaires. They were fooled and the CCP put an end to that.   Forcing companies to maintain full allegiance to the CCP prevents them from expanding and achieving their trye potential. BABA could have been great, but the CCP wouldn't allow it. You can invest in any CCP company, but you never know when you are going to wake up to a 20% loss on something you were up 30% on the day before because the CEO was seen buying a Winnie the Pooh stuffed bear for their daughter and now the company is being ripped to shreds with insane fines.](/r/stocks/comments/rqkw47/thoughts_on_investing_on_china_next_year/hqb9x6j/)

Many have said that China will step in for a bailout but up to this point they haven't done anything except try to clean up their public image. Then you have the Chinese government which unleashes random regulations out of the blue. Ask any BABA investors how they feel.

Your friend will have better luck if they look outside of Wake County. Taxes will be lower and traffic isn't nearly as bad. That said, our neighborhood was a farm field a year and half ago, and one of our neighbors is already selling his house for around $100k more than he paid for it.

In my mind, as long as you aren't deliberately harming anyone but yourself or following an ideology that is based on hate, you are good to go. I also think it's perfectly fine to put your own needs first as long as the above criteria is met, because if you don't care for your own needs other people won't care for them either. I don't mean run around like an egomaniac and use people, more like if you don't want to do something don't do it. If you feel uncomfortable in a situation, leave the situation and so on. 

However, I have massive issues with hypocrites. I really can't handle when people claim to support a cause and then do the exact opposite of it. I remember back in my school days we had a discussion in ethics class about sweat shops in Bangladesh and a lot of people stated that the working conditions there are so horrible and need to be improved, that they never would support something like this and so on. I said something along the lines of ""I don't believe that anyone actually cares about the working conditions there, because if people would they wouldn't buy clothing from brands that produce there, yet everyone walks around in H&amp;M jeans and Nike sneakers"".

It's going well, I've actually just done a 4 mile run in the wind and rain which I like - always good for mental training too. I find Nike+ is so cool, esp. with their audio-guided runs :) I think I'd be hard-pressed for a running partner - I do like the 5k/4-mile or even the 8 mile runs. But the 10 mile runs are the killer - usually 1.5 hrs and boredom kicks in. I have the audio-guided run that helps but I just need better places to run.

I guess I miss the excitement of starting a new game though and now and again I see adverts and wish I could play like RDR or the latest Farcry, Fifa, Battlefield etc. But I've moved on - I'll always have the memories! I think gaming was better in the late 90s and 2000s anyway XD 

But I must confess, it was more like 15-20 hours a week, no idea why I wrote 5-10, that's more the within-week gaming when I'm at work. Now I have a son (and this is just me, not saying all parents shouldn't game!) I feel I can't justify 2 hours a night gaming. There's so much more I could be doing! It is relaxing, you're right. But I find that I just can't get off the game. So many times I've said 'one hour' or 'one last game' and its just gone on and on... I can get addicted. Total Rome destroyed me!   


That's great that you've found starting a family has improved yourself :) I went through the same thing. The little potato really motivated me to make changes and be the Dad I want to be!

The green changed from Sport Teal to Deep Teal for the ‚Äô17 season when they switched into the Vapor Untouchable (from the Elite 51).

‚Ä¢ Country of Origin + Ascendancy (choose a main country to stick the player to a specific country or national team, and if you desire to make him look more authentic, you can add a ascendancy for the player, which will help in the process of choosing the player‚Äôs name and creating a background for him if you don‚Äôt give me one - e.g.: Paul Pogba - French player with Guinean ascendancy: despite being born and raised in France, Pogba has Guinean roots, with his two brothers being born in Guinea and playing for the Guinea NT; Riyad Mahrez - French- born Algerian player: born in France, Mahrez opted to play for Algeria NT due to ascendancy).

Point out up to two game specialities to make your player to have better attributes in desired aspects of its game. There are six attributes involved: Pace, Shooting, Passing, Dribbling, Defending and Physical. Leaving in blank will be recognized as a balanced type of player, that will be really complete in every single aspect of the game.

‚Ä¢ Other aesthetic player settings - player‚Äôs skin tone, type of hair, facial hair, eye color, preferred boot sponsor (Nike, adidas, Puma, etc.), goal celebration. If no setting is defined by the user, I‚Äôll try to make an accurate representation of what the player could and would look like based on nationality, player ascendancy and origins. Example: a  Brazilian player could be a player with a somewhat light brown skin, with dark curly hair and brown eyes (just like me, a Brazilian), but depending on their origins they could be different. Example: Brazilian player with Japanese origins. It would have a more Asiatic look to reflect their ancestors. (IMPORTANT NOTE: NO RACISM INTENDED. IT‚ÄôLL BE MADE FOR REALISTIC PURPOSES.)",1,Reddit,nike

3.	I‚Äôve noticed overall better quality and durability from apple/Nike bands but have been using a spoken rugged armor band for about 2 years now. It gives a more ‚ÄúG-Shock‚Äù sort of look to the watch and I personally love it.

As for the injuries, that is often a sign of weaknesses or lack of mobility in other places.  Or, trying to run too hard, too fast, or too far before your body is ready.  Build your running slowly.

Buttcoin,29/12/2021 07:30:17 AM,hqdvcru,"Anti-bitcoiner here. 
These are the problems I consider most pressing:
* unaffordable housing, education and healthcare
* amount of money being spend on illegal and unjust wars
* mass incarceration
* fossil fuel use and climate change
* a political system dominated by a small minority of people who benefit from all the above problems

I think the US dollar, as the hegemonic global reserve currency, is absolutely a weapon used to keep other countries poor and exploited by American corporations. How? Most high tech products, software, advanced drilling equipment, etc. is sold by American companies, and you need dollars to buy them. This means sanctions and secondary sanctions can economically destroy any country that makes Exxon, Nike or Levi‚Äôs unhappy.

So why don‚Äôt I support bitcoin? Because it doesn‚Äôt solve any of this. It doesn‚Äôt work as a currency (a constantly appreciating value means people won‚Äôt spend it and invest in real things), it‚Äôs owned by a very tiny handful of rich people in the first world, mining is cost prohibitive and environmentally destructive. Everything bad about the dollar is also true of Cryptocurrencies.

The solution is not changing currency, but guaranteeing people housing, healthcare and education as human rights, and for poor countries to expand trade relationships with one another and technological independence so they‚Äôre less vulnerable to US sanctions.

As for my own investments, I‚Äôll continue getting whatever 401k, real estate etc. assets I can to keep my family safe as long as I can. I agree that the future is bleak and things will get much worse before they get better - I wish cryptocurrency could help, but swapping currencies is really just a distraction from questions of political organizing.",1,Reddit,nike

WoWsBlitz,29/12/2021 05:22:33 AM,hqdjib6,"5 as in the mental age of 5, not literally 5 years old, it‚Äôs a metaphor


Who elected me to speak for the whole sub? Nobody, so you can have the point there, but I don‚Äôt recall many people screaming at the crate posts before


About winning some rare ship, I‚Äôm not referring to the post, but to the comment and using the rare ship as an example, unrelated to the key


OP is wrong to share an opinion? No, but does that make me wrong to say he‚Äôs wrong? And ‚Äúshare an opinion that WG benefits from losers (or WG‚Äôs hired help)‚Äù so anyone who made a post about winning some stuff from a crate is a loser now. Also where did you get that from? There‚Äôs some leaked information that WG hires propagandists now? Am I missing some crucial common knowledge? 


And the posting of winning stuff from loot crates is gonna cause weak-willed folks to spend their money on these crates with god-awful odds. People like showing off, whether it be their new car or some random 4 leaf clover they found. Now people who are tempted to make bad decisions in getting whatever seems nice do need help, since they can easily cause themselves major harm. But silencing these kinds of posts just to try and protect these people is not gonna solve the issue that they could still get hooked to the crates, or anything else in general. And also you don‚Äôt help people by lowering the chance for them to stumble into an addiction (there are plenty more things that are addictive in this world), you help them by teaching them that they shouldn‚Äôt get an addiction


‚ÄúYou dont like folks who have a different opinion than yours‚Äù I dont like the opinion bc it goes against mine, not bc its simply a different one. Also it‚Äôs literally ingrained in everyone, if I say ‚Äúsocial media should be banned bc people can get addicted to it‚Äù then there‚Äôs a good portion of ppl who are going to dislike me and disapprove of me, so should these people who disapprove of me stay out of social activities?


‚ÄúYou regulate reddit now?‚Äù It‚Äôs a suggestion, and also a small insult, and I‚Äôm not saying comment OP should be banned from this place


Also, ‚Äúcongrats to OP for getting his bright red Santa key‚Äù‚Äù1 in 1250 chance‚Äù youre now dragging OP into this now? The guy is just referencing how getting a key then getting canes is kind of like those present boxes that open up with another box inside, not necessarily calling out WG for the trash reward or showing off the loot he got


‚ÄúSome subs choose not to allow loot crate adverts‚Äù so the crate posts are now secretly ads for ppl to get crates? Does that make me showing off my new haircut an ad for the barber shop? Does that make me showing off a new pair of shoes an ad for Nike or whatever? If youre going by that metric then the whole world could be a massive ad?


‚Äúsome countries choose not to allow ads for smoking, gambling, drugs or sex‚Äù bc they‚Äôre much worst than most ads. And they‚Äôre ads, tailored to make people try and do it, and the crate posts here aren‚Äôt exactly here to promote crate boxes and more for showing off, could they maybe trigger a sense in ppl to open a loot box? Yes, but same thing with anything really, showing of anything, the only difference is that loot boxes are addicting while most ordinary things aren‚Äôt, so you are right in the sense that loot boxes should be discouraged, but they‚Äôre still gonna have exist in games, especially for mobile


I must say your pretty brave to say you burned 1000 Euros on the crates, that amount is a big deal right there, and awareness on not giving bloody WeeGee money on dumb crates should be spread far and wide. But the problem is banning the crate posts isnt gonna solve anything, people are just happy that they managed to win some rare stuff, they arent showing it off bc they wanna encourage people to spend money on the crates. And if the posts do end up encouraging you to spend money and get them, then I‚Äôm fairly certain that even everyday ads also encourage you to purchase their product. So if crate posts are a problem, then a whole lot of other things are too, these things are a part of life you kinda have to just accept it. Also there are plenty more ways you can get hooked on these crates, like those fancy ship ads that pop up when you open WoWSBlitz, or a guy doing a review of a ship that can only be obtained through crates, like Kaga for example, currently it can only be obtained through the heavy crate, should the review be taken down bc there are people who could get hooked on trying to get a Kaga themselves?


The problem of crates is that they can be addictive, but a lot of people here understand this, the problem lies within some people not being capable to not touch the crates with their money, so instead of outright banning posts of people being happy, perhaps tell people not to spend a single buck on crates, maybe a post or two telling people how crates have crap chances, sure a lot of people are simply gonna ignore it, as it doesnt help them, but it may help some guy who is just a slight bit tempted to spend some cash on crates.",1,Reddit,nike

Superstonk,29/12/2021 04:03:32 AM,hqdah6x,"Agree 100% that it will likely be similar, if not the same, to how the steam Market place functions. 

The two points for demand that I see is on the assurance that is gained from an NFTs contract. If the contract says 1 of 100 or 1 of 1, then there is a trust freez decentralized, ledger system that is able to offer that assurance to players. Secondly, and probably more importantly, will be transaction costs. If the cost for developers to use an NFT system is less then the cost to use steam, it will draw developers. Also, if they are able to remove publisher costs, they will likely flock.

A third potential point would be tangible copies of goods. A tangible copy of a game can now have an attached NFT to it. This might be relevant for something that sees counterfeit issues. In the future, I could see many collectable and brand loyal goods having authenticity via NFTs.  Examples that come to mind... Disney, Nike, Lamborghini, Rolex, MTG, etc.

I don‚Äôt work in marketing so maybe I‚Äôm wrong and phone photos/videos are typical, but I feel like it would at least be professional to have a dslr/mirrorless camera to do promo photos and videos for her clients SNS. 

Hey, Marketing Coordinator here. üëãüèΩ 

So, while I don‚Äôt have multiple clients like Emily‚Äôs does, I essentially do the same type of marketing but for one major client. Instagram is a huge marketing entity within itself, and it‚Äôs conveniently Emily‚Äôs major way of marketing for her clients. The quickest and easiest way to access Instagram is through your phone. So the fact that Emily is posting stories and photos from her phone the night of the event is completely okay. How else could she easily cover an event for social media in one night? 

While it would have benefited to have a professional photographer there, time wise, those photos taken by the photographer wouldn‚Äôt be ready in enough time to post for social. As long as your phone is to up to date with a decent quality camera (which it looked like Emily‚Äôs was), it‚Äôs okay to do that. 

Also, you have to remember, we live in the day and age of modern technology where literally everything is done on our phones. Almost all promotional content can be done on your phone within literal minutes. As annoying as Emily is, she‚Äôs doing just about what half of all real marketing teams do for big companies (Nike, Apple, Kelloggs).",1,Reddit,nike

fatlogic,29/12/2021 01:42:50 AM,hqcseea,"There's a weird debate going on right now in the running community. This blew up a few years back when runner Mary Cain claimed that she had been shamed for her weight at Nike (where her running career stalled) and that she was forced by her coach to use dangerous methods to get her weight down. Since then, a lot of the amateur running communities/organizations (like Runner's World) have really been pushing fat acceptance.

Now, her coach at the time (Alberto Salazar) is a known prick who violates rules all the time. That said, I think there needs to be a happy medium. Nobody should put their health in jeopardy to lose weight, but if you want to be the fastest runner, you'll have to be very thin (if you're a distance runner). The bottom line is that you can be overweight and run (although it's inadvisable; you'll hurt your knees) but you can't be overweight and the fastest. Mary Cain can campaign for body positivity all she wants, but it won't get her across the finish line first.",1,Reddit,nike

centrist,29/12/2021 01:38:50 AM,hqcrvi7,"&gt;I'm confused. Biden does take a stand ""because it's the right thing to do"" and you criticize him because he can't force people to sacrifice things? 

No. That was in response to you saying ""of course people in politics don't do things for altruistic reasons. Why should they?""

&gt;\&gt; Are China's Uyghurs constituents of any U.S. politicians?  
&gt;  
&gt;No, and I think that's exactly the point I'm trying to make. Biden's job as President isn't to right every wrong with the world. US voters and companies are perfectly happy to oppose what's going on in China...to a point, and so Biden is also to a point.

I never said it was his duty to right every wrong in the world. But what I'm arguing that this is, and what you seem to be defending, is machiavellianism.  

&gt;Again, not sure this cynicism is totally warranted. If you actually think of self-interest as a standard thing in all politicians and people, then we can be pretty confident we understand motivation. Basically this is the idea behind using game theory for political purposes.

I think it's warranted considering the track record of many politicians, if not most. In regards to Biden, he voted against military action against Iraq when Saddam literally invaded Kuwait. Yet, he voted for military action against Iraq in 2002 when Saddam had done nothing, and there was no evidence of WMDs. It was a political vote at the expense of American and Iraqi lives. He didn't want to look soft on terrorism so soon after 9/11. Same with Hillary Clinton, and same for Democrats who were up for reelection in swing districts. Democrats who weren't up for reelection and/or were in solidly blue states/districts, they voted against the Iraq War Resolution.

Often times, if it benefits politicians to do good, they'll do good. If it benefits them to support bad things, they'll support bad things.

&gt;Look up article discussing the summit in Alaska. In China's own words, America took a strong anti-China turn with the Biden administration.

Thanks for pointing me in the right direction. Although I didn't think Trump's trade war with China was a good thing, it looked to me like he was at least willing to challenge China. I'll be interested to see the Biden Administration's actions towards China, and how its playing out. 

&gt;Well these are for different things. Domestic issues that affect people in this country every day are understandably a bigger deal for US voters than issues halfway across the globe in another country.

I think when it comes to outright enslavement, it would make a difference. 

&gt;Nike WAS boycotted for a while

By who? Were politicians getting involved? I never heard about this, but I did hear about boycotts for Fox News commentators, Chik-Fil-A, and Cracker Barrel.

&gt; boycotting defending Chick-Fil-A are protesting human rights abuses against their families, coworkers, friends, and relatives, not strangers a hemisphere away. That doesn't make folks insincere, it makes them reasonably more invested in their own communities.

How was Chick-Fil-A engaging in human rights abuses?

&gt;Hey, I'll get behind the idea that voters are inconsistent with you. But what does that have to do with Biden? Complaining that voters/companies only sort of care doesn't equate to Biden being insincere.

It doesn't. My comment about ""putting your money where your mouth is"" was more towards the public in general.

&gt;First of all, lots of people don't like Pepsi but do like Coca Cola and vice versa. That's literally the case study on brand loyalty. 

Of course, but that's different from saying it will affect American's standard of living. Not to mention, there's a variety of different Coke-flavored products out there, not made by Coca-Cola. Yeah, I don't like Pepsi either, but I don't mind RC-Cola. Or I can easily switch up to Dr. Pepper. Or I can change it up further and drink the less unhealthy Snapple. Doing any variation of this is not going to harm or affect my standard of living.

&gt;Second, the purpose of a boycott is to harm that company's economic prospects to force them to make different choices. Well, these companies are American companies, so hurting them hurts American wallets. Don't get me wrong, I'm on board with the concept of boycotts overall and corporations crying over profit margins is to me the world's tiniest violin. But your point about voters and corporations being insincere doesn't mean our politicians are insincere in general or Biden in specific.

Politicians are a tool for citizens, not their parents or their friends. If Biden or any other president does something that benefits the public, an individual voter, or people suffering on the other side of the globe, great. But I'm not going to assume it's because they just wanted to do something good. It's all a game of chess to them.

&gt;Your original comment I responded to was calling Biden's actions ""lip service"" because they won't accomplish anything and then going on to complain about how the real problem here is that voters and corporations aren't sincere. You very much are connecting these things whether you're willing to explicitly admit it or not.

I changed that up at the end of that same post though, where I said, if it at least brings awareness to the issue, I'll give Biden credit for that.",1,Reddit,nike
liberalgunowners,29/12/2021 01:37:57 AM,hqcrre5,"You don't know how you'll react till you're there and even then the bravado of the fudd teaching your gun safety class won't imbue courage. Reality is, I carry a gun and pray I'll never draw it. I'm sure I'm not alone as a gun owner in wondering what I would do hearing gunfire a few aisles over from me in a target or what have you and I can tell you I plan to run and hide if that happened. Run, hide, fight if you get the chance to conceal your draw and fuck up the bad guy, otherwise don't be a hero.

A concealed gun is just another tool in the toolbox. You wear a seat-belt to diminish your risk in a car accident (thanks Nader, really). Similarly if I came face to face with a shooter in a grocery store or mall, I'd just be glad I also have a gun and I'm not 100% at their mercy. To be able to do that though and not be a casualty you have to be proficient, so take classes (even from the fudds I mocked aforementioned), take time at the range, get really comfortable with your gun and with having one on you in public concealed from the public eye.

centrist,29/12/2021 12:59:44 AM,hqcmo2o,"\&gt; Because it's the right thing to do.

I'm confused. Biden does take a stand ""because it's the right thing to do"" and you criticize him because he can't force people to sacrifice things? To say that leaders should do things for altruistic reasons but then also complain when those leaders don't back it up with stronger action is talking out of both sides of your mouth. Biden is a leader of a democracy. There's only so much coercion our system can allow. American voters and corporations don't want to hurt their wallets enough to back this up and you blame Biden's policy for its toothlessness?

\&gt; Are China's Uyghurs constituents of any U.S. politicians?

No, and I think that's exactly the point I'm trying to make. Biden's job as President isn't to right every wrong with the world. US voters and companies are perfectly happy to oppose what's going on in China...to a point, and so Biden is also to a point.

\&gt; Sincere meaning, they mean what they say, and don't have ulterior motives. Considering it's politics, I don't think anyone can say for certain that these politicians are sincere with their stated motives.

Again, not sure this cynicism is totally warranted. If you actually think of self-interest as a standard thing in all politicians and people, then we can be pretty confident we understand motivation. Basically this is the idea behind using game theory for political purposes.

\&gt; Interesting. I'll have to look into this.

Look up article discussing the summit in Alaska. In China's own words, America took a strong anti-China turn with the Biden administration.

\&gt; How would Americans damage their standard of living by boycotting Nike or Coca-Cola? I don't recall these considerations being made when politicians and people were leading boycotts of Chick-Fil-A.

Well these are for different things. Domestic issues that affect people in this country every day are understandably a bigger deal for US voters than issues halfway across the globe in another country. Nike WAS boycotted for a while boycotting defending Chick-Fil-A are protesting human rights abuses against their families, coworkers, friends, and relatives, not strangers a hemisphere away. That doesn't make folks insincere, it makes them reasonably more invested in their own communities.

\&gt; I think it's a questionable thing when people aware of China apparently using literal slave labor to manufacture Nike shoes, and people in the U.S. thinking, ""that's not good,"" and then buying their kids a new pair of Nikes.

Hey, I'll get behind the idea that voters are inconsistent with you. But what does that have to do with Biden? Complaining that voters/companies only sort of care doesn't equate to Biden being insincere.

\&gt; Again, how would American's standard of living be affected by a boycott of Nike or Coca-Cola? They'd just buy New Balance shoes and drink Pepsi instead.

First of all, lots of people don't like Pepsi but do like Coca Cola and vice versa. That's literally the case study on brand loyalty. Second, the purpose of a boycott is to harm that company's economic prospects to force them to make different choices. Well, these companies are American companies, so hurting them hurts American wallets. Don't get me wrong, I'm on board with the concept of boycotts overall and corporations crying over profit margins is to me the world's tiniest violin. But your point about voters and corporations being insincere doesn't mean our politicians are insincere in general or Biden in specific.

\&gt; I never made this connection. I never said that Biden's efforts were ultimately meaningless, since I said, at the very least, it would bring awareness to what's going on.

Your original comment I responded to was calling Biden's actions ""lip service"" because they won't accomplish anything and then going on to complain about how the real problem here is that voters and corporations aren't sincere. You very much are connecting these things whether you're willing to explicitly admit it or not.

\&gt; But if the majority of people are unwilling to boycott companies that use literal slave labor because they're only thinking about how that will effect the U.S. economy, then we can't really claim any moral high ground in regards to anything.

OK, sure, and this is one reason why I've mentioned that talking about governmental things primarily in moral arguments is silly...but that has little to do with Biden's actions only being ""lip service.""

Criticize voters and corporations all you want, I won't stand in your way there. But when you're connecting that to presidential performance you're overplaying your hand.",1,Reddit,nike

centrist,28/12/2021 11:42:59 PM,hqcc8bs,"&gt;I don't think it's fair to put ""sincere"" and ""altruistic"" in the same category. Of course folks in politics don't do things for altruism. Why should they? 

Because it's the right thing to do. 

&gt;Doing things that don't benefit constituents is kinda the opposite of what politicians are supposed to do. 

Are China's Uyghurs constituents of any U.S. politicians? 

&gt;Self-interest isn't a bad thing necessarily--in fact, political science nowadays sees it as a good thing that is the source of the basic feedback loops of society. Biden clearly does have a sincere interest in constraining China based on the fact that he's taken many moves to push on China. The fact that his self-interest is in line with that doesn't make it less sincere.

Sincere meaning, they mean what they say, and don't have ulterior motives. Considering it's politics, I don't think anyone can say for certain that these politicians are sincere with their *stated* motives. 

&gt;There's a reason when Biden's administration took over they immediately started putting pressure on those areas and China loudly complained that America under Biden took a much more anti-China stance than they did previously.

Interesting. I'll have to look into this. 

&gt;Oh, absolutely, voters only care so much. Voters do not want to massively damage their standard of living and GDP just to tell China they can't have concentration camps. 

How would Americans damage their standard of living by boycotting Nike or Coca-Cola? I don't recall these considerations being made when politicians and people were leading boycotts of Chick-Fil-A.

&gt;But that doesn't mean Biden isn't sincere, it means Biden is doing about as much as he can based on voter priorities which are honestly somewhat reasonable. No reason to criticize Biden or suggest he's insincere just because voters aren't willing to completely mortgage everything for this issue.

I question Biden's sincerity, like all presidents and politicians based on their history. It's not that I'm singling out Biden. I have some issues with him currently, but I voted for him over Trump, and I'll give him credit where credit is due, like how he just recently seriously curbed or ended the drone program in the  middle east.

&gt;Again, just because someone isn't willing to do whatever it takes doesn't mean they don't care. US voters do care about the Uyghurs to a point. That's not a reprehensible thing.

I think it's a questionable thing when people aware of China apparently using literal slave labor to manufacture Nike shoes, and people in the U.S. thinking, ""that's not good,"" and then buying their kids a new pair of Nikes.

&gt;Lots of people do. Some folks don't buy Nestle products, and my uncle is convinced that Google is evil because they harvest data, and Nike has been boycotted by Americans before. Sure. not many Americans will stop buying Coca Cola products or iPhones just because of labor abuses...but to assume that the only way to fight against this injustice is to personally harm your standard of living is a bit unreasonable. 

1) Of course at an individual level this exists. But prominent boycotts being led against these companies is not happening. Politicians and various activists groups were very vocal against Chick-Fil-A, and IIRC some cities have even banned.

2) Again, how would American's standard of living be affected by a boycott of Nike or Coca-Cola? They'd just buy New Balance shoes and drink Pepsi instead. And it's not like the boycott would put these companies out of business. It would be meant to put pressure on them to STOP utilizing slave labor for their manufacturing.

&gt;I agree it's a more effective way and it should be something Americans will consider, **but to say that Biden's diplomatic efforts are ultimately meaningless because Americans won't boycott isn't a reasonable understanding of the issue.**

I never made this connection. I never said that Biden's efforts were ultimately meaningless, since I said, at the very least, it would bring awareness to what's going on.

But if the majority of people are unwilling to boycott companies that use *literal* slave labor because they're only thinking about how that will effect the U.S. economy, then we can't really claim any moral high ground in regards to anything.

Accept that you'll have days you just can't commit to stuff. I'm still really new, and have days when I'll go down banks etc without a second thought, and other days when I just can't bring myself to do it. It is what it is. Frustrating, but so rewarding when you break that barrier.

See if there's anywhere around you that has group sessions for beginners. You can definitely teacb yourself, but it's so much fun learning with others, having someone there to help you out and watching others land something they've been working on for ages is almost as satisfying as doing it yourself.

Most of all though, just have fun with it!",1,Reddit,nike

vegan,28/12/2021 11:31:46 PM,hqcaoi2,"Yet someone gets blasted for eating their own chicken's eggs that would just go to waste versus someone who buys tomatoes that were produced in Mexico or owning a pair of Nike shoes or an iPhone. 

People care more about the label of what's vegan by blindly pointing to anything animal related feeling morally superior vs. actual suffering to living beings. 

The vegan community is forcing 'all or nothing' mentality down everyone's throats without any wiggle room for reduction and education to lead to a future looking more vegan. Using 'all or nothing' to change people's mindsets &amp; views rarely works. So many vegans would rather be self righteous than putting pride to the side &amp; actually getting people to change over time.

It took my mom two years to eventually go full vegan. She started with meatless Mondays at school. Got interested in making more dishes and became a vegetarian, and then eventually a vegan. It took a few years to get my sister to a mostly vegan place. My friend has mostly adopted veganism. I didn't approach them with a heap of information at once &amp; accuse everything they were doing as wrong or immediately state that they were contributing to animal suffering or slaughter. People have to figure it out for themselves with a little help. And with the way the vegan community operates with 'all or nothing' &amp; constant self righteous gatekeeping that brings people down rather than educate &amp; uplift, we won't be seeing a vegan future. 

Most of us weren't vegans at some point, we gotta stop acting like everyone else should instantly know &amp; recognize what's happening when it took some people 30+ years to get there in their life. So many vegans have an understanding for animals yet little understanding for humans. 

The worst part is seeing people on here being torn alive for not being 100% everything vegan. It's gross, I thought this community would be filled with a little more love and less double standards &amp; hate.",1,Reddit,nike

I have clothes only for exercising. There is type of textil that let your sweat evaporate and you can wash your body with those wet napkins. I use long sleeves and full body coverage and I think it is better, it does not stick sweat to your body. And it does dry SO fast.

I've convinced myself reading the world health organization book on exercise that I need to do it even if it hard, and it is, but the way I convince myself is always pondering everything with science and I do get used to new things because doing I discover ways to do it without feeling overwhelmed. 

For example, I've manage walking everyday in the sun, I hate the sun, highly anxious about cancer, so I put my fps, hat, long sleeve, pants, mask and I'm thinking about gloves, and people think I'm weird and look at me weirdly but I'm healthy. I go to the gym and I hate social situations, I just do it, haha, that's nike moto? Just do it. I get overwhelmed, but I'm getting used to it and others are too.

startups,28/12/2021 10:18:57 PM,hqc0dxm,"Here's a take from someone who has been working on it for the best part of the last 4 years on why, although I do think it's at peak hype at the moment, it will ultimately succeed:

1. It has a political/ philosophical implications, which retains talent. 
   1. I've seen this first hand: really freaking smart developers prefer to work on blockchain for 2 main reasons. 1. It's a beautiful mathematical exercise: zero knowledge rollups, Byzantine Fault tolerance algorithms, non-proof validations. These are things that, from a computational point of view, are beautiful complex problems to solve, and these type of people love these type of stuff. 2. The majority of devs would either work on this or trading algorithms for hedge funds. The point is, devs are usually anti-establishment, anti-status-quo and left leaning. At same remuneration and same complexity/ excitement for the problem, they'd rather work against the ""system"" or at least put it for good purpose.
2. There's a LOT of capital: most blockchain foundations by now have more capital than they would know what to do with. If they want to stir development somewhere, they have leverage to throw capital at it and outsource talent to work on it. I've seen it first hand too (won a couple of grants). There's enough money to push for this for the next decade. .
3. Too much web 2.0 involvement: by now Nike, Visa, Mastercard, Adidas, Gamestop, Unity, Facebook, Universal Music, Sony and tonnes more ""classical"" companies have made commitments and placed a bet on this being the new horizon. There's no coming back really. If it crashes, it has a much bigger repercussion than you think.

In conclusion, yes, it'll be a bumpy road, a LOT of people will get burned, but it's medium risk high reward situation. The ones that win will become the next trillion dollar company in 20 years. It's up to you whether you're willing to risk everything for that possibility. It excites me, but I do understand people that are not willing to do that jump.",1,Reddit,nike

Whilst they are all memes at the moment, they are a whole lot more than a JPEG. Besides art, they double as a borderline un-hackable digital representation of whatever you can imagine.

Some NFT's are a VIP ticket into a digital space, concert, meeting, viewing. They have a real world function of being something useful like a passport, things that there should only be one of.

Companies like Nike are buying digital plots of land in Sandbox and Decentraland to host such events. Guess who will have tickets? The edge lords who bought BTC back in 2012, cos they can afford a 20mil dollar pair of shoes for their avatar with a digital Minecraft jpeg around their necks like the interweebs finest bling

dankmemes,28/12/2021 09:24:32 PM,hqbsgr8,"THE EUROPEAN: A DAY IN THE LIFE

The European wakes up eager to start his virtuous European day and immediately a thought pops into his head. AMERICANS. This of course is a daily occurrence without fail.  ""I wonder what those stupid Americans are up to,"" he thinks as he instinctively opens up his favorite American website Reddit from his iPhone. He scrolls and scrolls seeking an opening to talk about America, anything to latch on to. He's totally not obsessed with Americans. He becomes bored so he turns his TV on and opens up Netflix. He puts on his favorite marvel movie for the billionth time and he goes back to scrolling. He loves engaging in American culture as he bashes America. He's totally not obsessed. He gets hungry and reaches for his iphone to order breakfast from McDonalds using uber eats. ‚ÄúStupid Americans making me eat their shitty food,‚Äù he thinks to himself, ‚ÄúEuropean food is so much better not even close.‚Äù He has eaten KFC 3 out of the last 5 nights for dinner. He waits downstairs for his food so he decides to put on some American rap music. ‚ÄúUgh stupid Americans,‚Äù he says ‚Äútheir culture is such shit! Not like European culture, we have history! and long-standing traditions. True culture comes from the wealthy!‚Äù A Muslim family crosses his path and he pretends to not be afraid and gives them a friendly nod and a wave. ‚ÄúWAAAOOOO‚Äù he thinks as he smirks so self-satisfied ‚ÄúI bet if this was America they would have shot them lol.‚Äù ‚ÄúUs Europeans are much more open-minded and civilized.‚Äù He nods agreeing with himself. His food arrives and makes his way back upstairs as he slurps down the coke Americans have forced him to drink. As he sits down to enjoy his shitty American food his Iphone receives an alert. NEW ZEALAND NOW HAS ZERO CORONAVIRUS CASES! ‚ÄúOh my fucking god!"" He yells! ""I am so gonna rub this in their stupid American faces!‚Äù He tweets, he posts on Instagram. He jumps on Reddit and comments with furor and xenophobia. He never really congratulates New Zealand or their success but instead talks about how Americans will all die from COVID and how they are all so stupid. The European posts charts and graphs he has archived to link when he is questioned. Hes totally not obsessed with America. Dont even joke around like that. Hes cooming with joy. ‚ÄúI really showed those stupid Americans today‚Äù he says to himself ‚Äúthey fucking deserve it, god damn imperialists,‚Äù he says without a shred of irony. Felling extra good about his exploits he decides to go out and enjoy his blessed, virtuous, pretentious Euroday. He laces up his Jordans nice and tight. He puts on his favorite Batman shirt and Nike sweater. As he walks out he grabs a piece of cardboard sitting by the door. The European is now on his way out to protest about something happening in the U.S. Standing in a bus with 300 other people in it he has a thought. Why DO I care so much about things happening in America...Am I obsessed with American life?‚Äù he thinks as he yells Black Lives Matter from his 90% white, European country.",1,Reddit,nike

centrist,28/12/2021 09:21:56 PM,hqbs35e,"\&gt; It's rare in politics for anything to be motivated for sincere or altruistic reasons.

I don't think it's fair to put ""sincere"" and ""altruistic"" in the same category. Of course folks in politics don't do things for altruism. Why should they? Doing things that don't benefit constituents is kinda the opposite of what politicians are supposed to do. Self-interest isn't a bad thing necessarily--in fact, political science nowadays sees it as a good thing that is the source of the basic feedback loops of society. Biden clearly does have a sincere interest in constraining China based on the fact that he's taken many moves to push on China. The fact that his self-interest is in line with that doesn't make it less sincere. 

\&gt; I'm not fan of Trump, but was he not engaging in aggressive policies towards China? It's not like it can't be done or hasn't been done.

Sort of. First of all, let's be clear that Biden has actually placed additional sanctions on China and is largely keeping many of the same ones that Trump put in place. But the reality is that those sanctions aren't actually as big a deal as Trump made them out to be. A trade war with China doesn't actually hurt China that much because at the end of the day Americans really depend on Chinese business, both in buying lots of their stuff and in them buying our stuff. I mean, sure, we COULD really use trade to hurt China by banning Disney, Apple, pro sports, Google, etc from doing business in China. But that would also hurt the American economy quite a bit. The point is that Trump's ""trade war"" didn't actually hit China where it hurt because doing so would hurt American business just as much if not more. And where there was real potential to hurt China in pushing back on their imperialism, anti-democratic tendencies, and human rights abuses, Trump mostly punted. There's a reason when Biden's administration took over they immediately started putting pressure on those areas and China loudly complained that America under Biden took a much more anti-China stance than they did previously.

In short, focusing just on tariffs isn't actually hurting China all that much and China's perfectly happy for the US to ""be tough on China"" if being tough on China is placing tariffs on stuff and that's it.

\&gt; Same goes for American corporations. They don't have to capitulate to China, but they chose to because they can make more $$$ doing so.

Yeah, exactly. We can't just economically damage China without getting economically damaged ourselves, which is a bit of self-defeating strategy. Which is exactly why Biden is doing what he's doing and not more, which is kinda the point I was trying to make all along.

\&gt; The ""U.S."" doesn't really care, because if they did, there'd be a massive pushback and boycott against companies like Nike and others who use exploitive and forced labor in China.

Oh, absolutely, voters only care so much. Voters do not want to massively damage their standard of living and GDP just to tell China they can't have concentration camps. But that doesn't mean Biden isn't sincere, it means Biden is doing about as much as he can based on voter priorities which are honestly somewhat reasonable. No reason to criticize Biden or suggest he's insincere just because voters aren't willing to completely mortgage everything for this issue.

\&gt; I never implied that, nor do I think that baby boomers have that impression either. It's more a case of putting your money where your mouth is.

Again, just because someone isn't willing to do whatever it takes doesn't mean they don't care. US voters do care about the Uyghurs to a point. That's not a reprehensible thing. 

\&gt; If we really cared, we'd be boycotting these companies, right?

Lots of people do. Some folks don't buy Nestle products, and my uncle is convinced that Google is evil because they harvest data, and Nike has been boycotted by Americans before. Sure. not many Americans will stop buying Coca Cola products or iPhones just because of labor abuses...but to assume that the only way to fight against this injustice is to personally harm your standard of living is a bit unreasonable. I agree it's a more effective way and it should be something Americans will consider, but to say that Biden's diplomatic efforts are ultimately meaningless because Americans won't boycott isn't a reasonable understanding of the issue.",1,Reddit,nike

exmuslim,28/12/2021 08:48:25 PM,hqbn6lx,"Hey, hi. Though those might seem impressive at first, it still is not a convincing prophecy and as always with all those prophecies, extremely vague:

1) He claims that ""predators speaking to people"" is telecommunication. How does he know that? How do we know that? According to dictionary, predator has 2 main meanings:  
1.An animal that naturally preys on others.  
""wolves are major predators of small mammals""  
2.A person who ruthlessly exploits others.  
""a sexual predator""

 Muhammed could probably have meant that in the end times, fear and threats, bad intentioned people will be abundant and so probably made such a prophecy ""predators"" might be referring to bad people. This is not something special, a prophet claimant predicting that bad things will happen near the end, classic doomsday prophecy we find in all cults and religions so he might as well have just predicted that predators ""bad people"" will be so prevalent in the end that they will talk to people, apprehension will be common etc classic doomsday prophecy ""bad things will happen in the future"" type of stuff we find in many different religions also which Muslims would not accept. This phrase ""predators talking to people"" has nothing to do with telecommunication and is definitely a huge stretch.

2) The thigh phone issue: This is still not impressive. This  actually refers to a needless invention where a case like stuff is added to the thigh of a person where he/she can put the mobile phone instead of his/her pocket/bad etc. Again, in this case the thing which is informing the person is not actually his thing, that is just where the phone is put.. And the prophecy phrases this like after the man  left ,he is informed by his thigh what had happened to his family like the hadith assumed like the thigh is a reporting part of body but thighphone has a great diversity of functions and simplifies the functions of a phone to ""informing the person what had happened to his family after ht left home"" is quite evading the issue.

3) Walls having ears is referring to communication? really you find this convincing? Thjis also might just as well be referring to him predicting that in the future near end times secrets will be propagating so fast etc and using an euphemism for this through the phrase ""walls will have ears"". etc. This is just a stretch.

4) Regarding the jujitsu stick issue, I still don't find this claimed prophecy impressive and vague. Fujitsu stick is a technological crane developed to help old people and has functions like measuring temperature, hearth rate, helping old people find their way and one of its functions is to send message to relatives etc if a serious issue happens. I think this prophecy fails on several grounds:

 2- If you search for the ""jujitsu technological stick"" it is specifically designed for helping the old people. This is not speciere which complicates this. The technological crane is definitely not a whip and smiling this device to a whip would be problematic and a stick would be a better word to use to describe this device. Is this a whip, stick or shoe? This is not specifically mentioned in the hadith which makes the prediction blurry. Te prophecy uses ""or"" here so the only options is not a stick. Which one Muhammed specifically refers to? A whip or a shoe cannot describe this crane for old people. This is not mentioned in the hadith as there are ""or"" words which complicate this.

 2- If you search for the ""jujitsu technological stick"" it is specifically designed for helping old people. There is no mention of this in the hadith about old people. If he had mentioned that the stick will help old people, the prophecy could have been more convincing and specific; but it doesn't mention anything about old people using this stick so again makes the prophecy vague.

3- One other mistake is that the hadith specifically says "" his shoes or whip or stick will tell what is happening to his family"" implying that this stick will inform his owner about what happened to his family. This is false, it is exactly the opposite when it comes to Fujitsu stick. s the old people use it, it is informing his family of what happened to him, his location etc when an incident etc happens.  The fujitsu stick's main function is not to inform the old man(user) about his family(as implied in the hadith) but the exact opposite. This is also an issue with this prophecy.

4) ""He claims the tip of a mqns whip speaks to him is reference to smartphones: ""However, today, in fulfilment of this prophecy, we see people holding on (continuously) to their smartphone like a whip, he speaks to it (the microphone) and it (the speaker) speaks to him (during calls)."""" Really? Is that really what the hadith says?  The hadith is "" until the tip of a man‚Äôs whip and the straps on his sandal (shoe) speak to him"" Really trying to interpret this hadith as referring to people holding onto their smartphones and talking through them is just farce. This doesn't really need an explanation. Anyone who honestly looks at the actually hadith and what is being tried to implied can see that this is just pure stretch. The person tries to create analogy between a man using his whip and a smartphone. He tries to claim that a person becoming addicted to smartphone is like a person holding a whip. But the hadith has no mention of a person being addicted, always frequently holding into his whip. Yes, people now continuously hold into their smartphones but there is no mention of anything about people continuously holding onto their whips like an addition frequently etc in the hadith. And comparing a whip to a smartphone is just preposterous and needs no explanation. If a man 2000 years before said that ""One day will come when people's sword will talk to people"" and people now claimed that this predicted mobile phone, what would your reaction be?  This is like this. A whip has no analogy to a mobile phone.

5) About the speaking Nike shoe thing, the hadith about this is: ""the straps on his sandal (shoe) speak to him"" yeah, this seems quite impressive though I still don't find this prophecy convincing. The hadith is not specific. You don't have to communicate with god/divine to utter a statement like ""A time will come when shoes will talk to people"" in the ancient world. This prediction is at best sci-fi prediction. A lot of sci fi writers predicted landing on the moodn or space shuttles years before those things happened. Were they prophet or did they need divine knowledge to predict this? No. Most importantly Shoe and talking were known concepts in the ancient world, combining these two and claiming that a time will come when shoes will talk to people is not impressive. And notice that in the hadith, it says specifically ""the straps on the shoe"" talking. We have no evidence that the straps are specifically the ones making the talking function on the Nike talking shoe or any other mechanism anywhere else on the shoe other than straps.  Just ask yourself, in the ancient world, for an average person to predict something like ""a time will come when shoes will talk to people"" simply than nothing more, for such a statement to be made, does he really need to communicate with god or any divine? Ships, vessels and moon were known concepts in the past even before astronomy progressed and people started going to mars or moon. But many sci fi writers predicted that such a thing would happen years before. Is this a prophecy? No because they are not inventing anything new or special. Vessels and moon were known concepts were always and they were just combining two through their imagination and it came true. Same with this prophecy. Shoes and talking were known concepts to Muhammed, for him to use his imagination and picture a potential world where shoes will talk, he doesn't need to communicate with god.",1,Reddit,nike

The vast, vast majority of people don‚Äôt care enough about [issue] to make a dent. Whether the anger is coming from the left or the right, it‚Äôs hard to come up with examples of a large company being truly affected due to outrage over a social issue. 

The closest example I can think of is Proctor and Gamble needing to write down the value of Gillette after the backlash to the ‚Äúmen are bad‚Äù commercial‚Ä¶but even that has blown over and P&amp;G is at all time highs.

However, I travel to visit my relatives in a country that is quite poor and everyone has Nike t-shirts or basic trainers or something. My grandad has this dirty Nike baseball cap that he wore for ages. So my thinking is that \_mostly\_ Nike is a brand that is fine but nobody is going to be wowed by your new Nike sneakers. Whereas with truly luxury brands, they are aspirational, they are desired, people willing to pay ridiculous money for them and show off so I understand the premium. 

Also, to your example, yes Fiat owns Ferrari, its good one, but then also Ferrari has 50% gross and 20% net margins because people are willing to pay massive premium for an OK but exclusive car. Fiat is churning out mass product cars and their gross is 20% and net is barely 7%. Stellantis also trades at 4x PE and Ferrari is trading at 53x PE. That makes sense.

OutOfTheLoop,28/12/2021 08:05:46 PM,hqbgvfa,"I think it‚Äôs important to understand that this technology is still very early. Any discussion around it is going to be very speculative, mine included. I‚Äôm mostly talking about what‚Äôs possible. How it actually plays out could be much different. 

&gt;only works if all company‚Äôs agree to it

Yes, and there are already decentralized games and worlds, like decentraland and others that allow you to create and sell NFTs. You don‚Äôt need decentraland‚Äôs permission create a wearable Luka Nike. So, when we‚Äôre talking about items between games, Nike is the one that controls where they want their shoes to be worn. So then, 

Nike sells shoes in decentraland, and other decentralized games and THEY control which games accept their NFTs. Nike has a STRONG incentive for games, particularly sports games, to completely decentralize their style and merch in game. Now it‚Äôs a battle between game publisher and massive retail brand. Who do you think is most likely to get their way, Nike or EA?

&gt;who gets the profits

Percentage split between seller/creator/publisher

&gt;why not make you buy the same item in both games?

Depends on who has the leverage and who have the biggest incentive behind this tech? Personally, I think major retail brands have the leverage and incentive to start working with publishers to integrate blockchain. Eventually, you‚Äôll be able to walk into a physical Nike store, buy the newest Luka‚Äôs in a ‚ÄúNFT bundle‚Äù and be able to wear those Luka‚Äôs in real life but also in NBA 2k, decentraland, Meta and any othe decentralized game Nike chooses. 

&gt;not caring much for this &amp; micro transactions

I agree in a sense. I agree this will increase transactions in our lives. But i think the good that comes come from this outweighs it. Artists have more freedom to create careers out of their work, the stock market has more transparency and ownership, running nonprofits and fundraising is easier, plus many other uses I don‚Äôt even know about.",1,Reddit,nike

Which is fairly standardized in shoe manufacturing. But you have less standardization in shoe width and whatnot. Like Nike tends to run much narrower than New Balance. 

The perfect shoe exists for each individual. But finding that shoe is a nightmare. So most people just find whatever is most acceptable. I dont want to shop for shoes for months at a time. 

It's just not profitable or even always possible to cater to the 1%. In any business really. If you can satisfy 99% of customers or even like 90% you are doing quite well. The cost of catering to that weird 1% grows like wildfire. If that 1% IS profitable enough, there will be a business for it. But it will likely be alot more expensive. Custom shoes are a thing, but substantially more expensive than your run-of-the-mill stuff.",1,Reddit,nike

starterpacks,28/12/2021 06:13:32 PM,hqazx86,"It also completely explains the ""weird"" ending.

I used to think the perfect ending was in season five - he's married again to a brunette copy of his wife, he's gonna let her pursue her dreams instead of saddling her with kids like he did with Betty, and someone comes up to introduce a friend to him in a bar and asks ""are you alone?"" Because the series is very much about American loneliness.

But if you take that beat/ending, with season 1's ending, wirh the series finale, a very interesting picture emerges.

There's a book called ""anti-oedipis: capitalism and schizophrenia"" that would actually *go on to influence the entire business plan of buzzfeed.* The Marxist writers of the book explain that capitalism inherently makes you feel lonely. They're expanding on Marx's assertion of alienation that in capitalism you will feel lonely because you aren't the owner and maker of a good but a cog and machine; the writers go in to say ""no, capitalism has advanced so much that people will not just feel lonely, but without identity, ant the way to *build identity will be by buying things*. You're not a Whole Foods buyer, you're a Trader Joe's buyer. You're team adidas not team Nike. The owner of buzzfeed said this is why he built buzzfeed - people are so listless and lonely and without identity that taking ""which Disney character are you?""appeals to people in late stage capitalism. (Note, if you reader Marxists, ""late"" in late stage means ""current"" not ""final"".) And then they would take the info from these quizzes and sell them as consumer profilers to people like Don.

I mention all of this because *Don is the architect of this type of loneliness*. He fucking says ""people buy things to find out something about themselves."" His entire work is about assualting the American consciousness. ""Advertising"" In other languages is correctly called ""propaganda"" - because that's what it is. His goal is to sell you the image of carousal when the reality for many people is the same loneliness he feels. *And the reason the carousel pitch works is because people feel the same loneliness he feels.* His work is about turning the American populace not into people, *but into consumers*. And as consumers you will continuously buy things in the hope that it will make you feel human again. And that's why it ends on a coke ad that fucking preaches togetherness and community. Because this turning of people into not citizens but consumers makes you feel lonely, all you are is a thing that fucking buys, and thing you actually want more than anything is community, a feeling that you are no longer alone - and you will never fucking get it in late stage capitalism.

But you can buy a coke.",1,Reddit,nike

The old batch of chicago was claimed by some people as being a really exclusivity of SK, but it wasn‚Äôt neither.
It was actually a pretty unknown batch, known as ‚ÄòQingYuan bare shoes factory‚Äô that used to cooperate also with another factory, that apparently now is out of business and that is usually confused with Y3 for being located in the same city (Heyuan), which was the ‚ÄòHeyuan bare shoes factory‚Äô. 
These two are no-code factory that really used to mix fake and real materials, and used to cooperate for create incredible shoes, working on that field for years.

For reference the shoes that SK used to sell that belonged to these factory mix were: The SK1, The SBB 1.0, the Chicago, the sole fly, and other. Shoes that Gao too used to sell but now they‚Äôre completely OOS, and other sellers. 
And note that those two sellers actually take stock from others.

Another shoes that might belongs to QY bare shoes factory are the igloo/rust pink. SK always used to say that those two shoes come from a Guangdong specialized factory. And yea, guangdong is the province of Qingyuan, where the factory is located.

Actually this batch is sometimes defined as XC, the retail nike factory. And most of times tho the ‚ÄòQY bare shoes‚Äô name is used for rename shoes that are actually worse.
But this factory is not producing new shoes anymore, maybe we will see new release in the next years, but who knows.

Then SK, after this batch being OOS, updated the Chicago with a new batch and as i wrote on [my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/repbudgetsneakers/comments/rfx9ci/aj1_chicagos_ljr_vs_dt_batch_review_in_comments/hojfuke/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) this batch might just be Y3. Which in some things is better than LJR. But as we see SK‚Äôs keep changing batch so we won‚Äôt really know.

But do note that actually Y3 is not that good for some aj1 colorways. I had mocha in this batch that were nice and obsidian that were very bad.
On the other hand, Y3 chicago are very good. 
And note that a lot of sellers already use to rename actual Y3 Chicago batches with another name, so what SK‚Äôs doing now is nothing new. Just usually things that china seller does.

On the other hand, there are many batches that foreign customers don‚Äôt know, and that is better that they‚Äôre not known at all. Especially in this sub actually",1,Reddit,nike
NoStupidQuestions,28/12/2021 05:12:15 PM,hqaqm9r,"Oh, sorry, I didn't think about how to put a positive spin on child labor.  Give me a f\*\*\*ing break.

Did Nike have to close the factory?  How about telling Nike to pay a decent wage to ADULTS so the adults can support their children?  Children have been put to work because the factory owners can pay them less than they pay adults and then tell the families they're giving their families a chance and pretend they're heroes while banking ***billions***.  What a load of crap.

Sounds like you're the one swallowing something whole.  They're in your country exploiting your children - and polluting your water - because they're not allowed to in the US.

CryptoMarkets,28/12/2021 04:44:36 PM,hqamf6a,"Plutus. A crypto debit card provider with tiny market cap and a functioning co stantly updated and maintained product. 

There is going to be an uodate in q1 2022 regarding the rewards which will make it a close competition to Cro and their own perks. 
The rewards mechanisms explained beliw are the current pre update ones and in the future the actual rewards will improve greatly to users benefit. 

What is PLU **TLDR:**

PLUTUS is a non custodial credit card on which you get to keep your own keys thus not running the risk of losing funds due to the centralised nature of all other credit card options out there. You connect your account to Metamask and thats it, easy. The cashback rewards are up there with the biggest crypto credit cards such as Coinbase and Crypto.com.

As a crypto project PLUTUS is still in its infancy as seen both in the time its existing and its marketcap. Regardless, the tokenomics are planned for long term sustainable growth and the team is constantly active with updates and community voting and surveys, keeping both the community active and alive while also making proper adjustments.

I definetly advise you to take a further look into their website and platform and see for yourself.

**I sleep better at night knowing that my funds are safe on my Ledger and accessible on my Credit Card through Metamask. No other Card offers this security!**

Read on for further details.

**General Overview**

*Cashback Rewards*

This is where PLUTUS and the PLU token come in. PLUTUS offers cashback deals of a current minimum baserate of 3% with some upgrades allowing for a contant 5% and certainrewards reaching up to 15% for certain retailers. Most importantly these are not only small time companies that you can get cashback from, in fact big companies such as NIKE APPLE LENOVO AMAZON LOGITECH and many more are included within the list.

Moreover the Rewards will be updated as indicated in the Roadmap 2.0 that was released some weeks ago. Plutus is looking to add more companies to their extensive support perks with Netflix Spotify Lidl Aldi Apple amongst others to offer increased cashback rewards to subscriptions and purchases. They will integrate an NFT function of the perks in which you can upgrade your account with an NFT to receive additional Perks for extra cashbacks. More on this will be released in 2022. 

*Non-Custodial Decentralised Staking*

Other than the amazing rewards offered by the card another thing that puts this card in first place when it comes to crypto cards is that it offers decentralised staking. What this means is that your funds (both the funds you stake and those you use to buy goods) are stored on the wallet of your choice such as METAMASK. This means that you are in full control of your wallet, unlike the other cards for which you have to keep your funds on the platform of the cards company itself.

*Tokenomics*

Tokenomics of the project are very reasonable and aimed for a long term future. A max supply of 20m PLU with the remaining 17.15m PLU reserved for the PLU Reward System, the source of the 3% PLU Cashback rewards. The emission rate is variable depending on the volume of the PlutusDEX.

Furthermore, to facilitate long term healthy growth the PLU reward rate is deflationary, meaning as usage grows, the rate at which PLU is emitted decreases. This model ensures scarcity while making it even more profitable for early adopters.

As the volume of the PlutusDEX remains 30BTC or less, the reward rate will always be 3%. Following that, every increase of 0.1BTC results in a 0.0165% reduction in the reward rate up to a minimum rate of 1%.

*Team and Community*

PLUTUS as a company has a long way to grow it is relatively new both in marketcap and age and they are definitely doing all things right. Constantly developing their platform to the needs of their customers. Very high community engagement and excellent customer service with several rewards being shared other than their staking rewards and cashback. The team has a combined experience of over forty years in payments, financial trade, and software development, the Plutus team is more than well prepared to revolutionise the usage of crypto-assets.

I see what you‚Äôre saying, but Google is slowly eliminating the ability to use extensions, additionally, extensions can be and sometimes are malicious and can put things on your computer you didn‚Äôt intend to download. Brave eliminates that problem. Both Google, Firefox, and most other browsers are in the business of selling you and your information. Brave allows you to have ownership over that. It‚Äôs more nuanced than you want to make it. It‚Äôs not as simple as Ads no Ads. It‚Äôs about making money off of your information and not profiting off of you.

for paper 1, 2 literary extracts. SL choose 1, HL made to analyse both

for HL essay (only for HL students), lit students must analyse 1 literary work, langlit students can either analyse 1 literary work or 1 non literary work (like streetart, song, nike advertisements etc etc)

paper 2 also cancelled for me so cannot comment hahah

also the common consensus is that langlit is easier, but i actually disagree. i think that with langlit, there are so many different niche text types (eg. comics, newspaper article, magazine article, advertisement, speech and the list goes on!) that can throw you off in the exam if you don't know how to analyse it properly, whereas for lit there's more predictability in that you'll \*always\* get a poem/prose/non fiction/play. my teacher (taught both lit and LL) said that sometimes her LL students struggle more bc there are too many text types to learn, and also analysing the niche ones can be tricky. but respectfully, this is just my opinion!!",1,Reddit,nike

I usually buy stuff that I know I'll use. So it's expensive salon shampoos, makeup, skin care (excl jap and Korean brands). Sports stuff from Nike Adidas UA etc not much cheaper but so different from what we have 

'luxury' brands like coach ck Kate spade. 

Shoes... All types. Formal casual sport. There's always a sale or shops that sell last season stuff so it's discounted

For entertainment, I've picked a Adidas Superstar CNY from February. I picked it to get all the Nike fans to reply and say something different.

  


Rules for the sleeper pick:

1. It cannot be an Jordan 1. Any Jordan 1 suggestions will be downloaded to oblivion.

2. You cannot suggest a Jordan 1 colorway.

3. You can't vote for a Jordan 1 collaboration.

4. If you bought Jordan 1s this year because of all the hype, please open your sneaker research to a broader set of options. In the old days, sneaker shopping was about showing your personality with what you wear. Now it feels like Jordan head office are taking the piss with all these colorways. If you love your speakers, and Jordan 1 was your ""gateway drug"" into sneaker hype, keep your love for Jordan, but next time look further for Specialist sneakers.

1. A brandname of peanut butter.  
  
2. A term used to describe somthing that is really cheesy, flimsy or cheap. This particular definintion of the word was developed from the poor kids of the late nineteen seventies and early eighties whose families could not afford Nike or Converse sneakers. Instead, they were left with no choice but to wear ""Skippies."" Skippies were a generic blue sneaker usually with three stripes on the sides(number of stripes varied from 2-4). Skippies were available at budget minded stores such as K-Mart or Spags. Within the store, Skippies could be found tied together(no box or packaging)piled loose in bins often located in the isle. Skippies were of poor quality and fell apart quickly. Their appearance was cheap queer or gay. Hence anything cheap, flimsy or generic in nature can be called skippy. Or, if something looks cheesy or gay it canbe reffered to as ""Skippy""

AskReddit,28/12/2021 01:41:53 PM,hq9xyha,"I grew up comfortable (Asian, F). Went to boarding school for 6 years and then private US college. My parents bought me my first car (a Toyota) and gifted me the down payment for my first house. I always had everything I ‚Äúneeded‚Äù and I‚Äôd consider my family to be wealthy, but I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù like most rich kids with unlimited funds, fancy cars, designer stuff etc. 

My husband (Polish/Italian)grew up on food stamps with his father (who had a very physically demanding manual job) and 2 younger siblings. He got his first job as a paper boy and always had 2-3 jobs growing up. As a teenager, he bought his own clothes and shoes and his first car etc. He went to a crappy city school where he spent all day running from other kids who would try to beat him up and steal his clothes and shoes (Nike stuff). He barely graduated high school because he didn‚Äôt actually have any time to learn in school when he was spending all his time just trying to survive. He decided to get into skilled trades and skip college cause he didn‚Äôt see the benefits of going to college and spending decades paying it off (not to mention he didn‚Äôt really have the grades either), and he would rather just start working and getting paid. 

We met online 10 years ago. Our personalities are totally opposites (I‚Äôm kind of an impatient control freak and he‚Äôs a laid back, unorganized,simple, nice guy) even though we share some similar traits (we‚Äôre both very stubborn) and have similar views/opinions about most things. My parents (dad, specifically) were against us getting married and my dad almost didn‚Äôt come to our wedding. They said it was because he‚Äôs not Asian and doesn‚Äôt speak the language and doesn‚Äôt understand our culture etc, but I know deep down it‚Äôs because he grew up poor and didn‚Äôt go to college and works a blue collar job. We‚Äôve been married 5 years now and still going strong. He lets me be who I am and loves me unconditionally even when I am being a super mega crazy bitch at times. We do have very different views and opinions on certain subjects due to our backgrounds and upbringings, but we typically just agree to disagree when we come across those moments. We sometimes argue, but we call them ‚Äúhealthy debates‚Äù and not ‚Äúfights‚Äù. 

A few months ago, we went through some serious trauma. It was the biggest trauma of my life (so far) but my husband helped me through it like a pro. He‚Äôs experienced a lot of personal trauma even as an adult and at one point in his life - he had lost EVERYTHING. We met when he was at the lowest point of his life and I helped him turn it around. So in a way, I think we both got lucky in meeting each other :)",1,Reddit,nike

ModernMagic,28/12/2021 12:42:31 PM,hq9rzxh,"I think to answer this question you need to look at it objectively.

TL:DR - Monkey expensive, Monkey good.
Monkey no have prowess, Monkey have no place in Prowess.

Why is Goblin guide better than raging goblin?
Haste 2/2 giving your opponent a card is it really better than a haste 1/1?
Yes! Dealing 2 points of damage before your opponent has even looked at their hand is amazing, and if they get a land? Meh at least we know.

Not only that but our 2/2 on T1 can now kill a 2/2 or 3/2 played turn 2 or 3.
I‚Äôve had many a burn game where I‚Äôve managed to get 6 points through before getting clumped. Compared to Raging goblin I would have got 1 point of damage through before my opponent played a 2/2 the next turn.

So does this massive power increase justify goblin guide being ¬£5 and raging goblin being ¬£0.10. Yes.

Now why is goblin guide ¬£5, well before Covid it was ¬£25-30 and I was looking at getting a play set for GP. Now after Covid it‚Äôs ¬£5. ¬£7 for a fancy limited edition art version why? 
Has magic got less popular? Is it less expensive? No it‚Äôs been reprinted 50,000 times at rare. 
And it only sees play in 1-2 decks in modern (I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs more but I‚Äôve only seen it in burn and mono red)

Now why is ragavan selling for ¬£50 a card? Because it‚Äôs better than goblin guide? Debatable, they both serve different purposes. Because it‚Äôs rarer than Goblin guide? Yes definitely an impact factor. Because it‚Äôs only been printed in 1 set, and is a massive chase card for that set? Yeah it‚Äôs that.

My LGS has a massive card collection, and they only recently had 4 monkeys to be put into the owner deck. None for sale.
So the supply is limited and the demand is high.

In terms of more powerful cards, there is a power creep that you need to accept.
Raging goblin is a 1/1 with haste for R
Fanatical Firebrand is a 1/1 with haste for R, with an additional ping effect.
Both are common.

The difference is about 15 years, things get stronger, to make cards worth buying they need to be better than the ones before. In a game as big as magic, they‚Äôre running out of effects and ways to reword things.

The solution? Accept that this is an expensive hobby at the competitive levels, all hobbies are. Start playing casually with friends using calmer decks, I do it‚Äôs fun. Or play things that are cheaper, burn is about ¬£300 for the lands and all.
As an avid rugby player I started off with cheap kit 8 years ago, then I bought some new boots for ¬£20 in the sale. We‚Äôre they as good as my friends ¬£200 Nike ones? No, but they fitted and kept my feet dry. 
You can‚Äôt complain that a something good is expensive, I know it‚Äôs a hobby and I also can‚Äôt justify paying so much for a bit of cardboard, so I don‚Äôt,
 my newest deck is squirrels, it cost me ¬£11. Is it the most competitive? Not at all, but is it fun yes.

Superstonk,28/12/2021 12:33:22 PM,hq9r64b,"Well...  I'm not at work so have some text guys- 

&gt;But what is the metaverse though?  
It‚Äôs bad news for grandmas who were just starting to understand how to use Gmail with a mouse and keyboard.  
It‚Äôs the successor of the internet. The tech leap that will make the web into something more than just a bunch of underwater tubes.  
It‚Äôs hype for media outlets, #HODL material for early investors.  
But to you and me? The metaverse is just the next tech thing that will make everyone hilariously rich except us.  
We‚Äôre slow adopters, so we‚Äôll miss this opportunity too  
Are you still lamenting not buying Bitcoin back in 2011 when it was worth one dollar?  
I‚Äôm sure you preferred tossing that coin into a fountain, cause however much ‚Äúgood luck‚Äù you could get was still a safer investment than trading imaginary currency.  
And, you know. At least people didn‚Äôt laugh in your face if you wasted money on superstition.  
But look at you now, you skeptic little Johnny-come-lately, disregarding NFTs as ‚Äúoverpriced JPEGs,‚Äù praying for the bubble to pop. If we lived in the year the wheel was invented, I‚Äôm sure most of us would laugh at those bumping battle chariots until someone came up with the breaks.  
We‚Äôre slow adopters. How do I know that you ask?  
Early birds are reaping the metaverse right now  
Fair enough, the technology is still far from looking like an episode of Black Mirror. And it will be another 10‚Äì15 years until Morpheus starts approaching people with the red pill.  
But that‚Äôs not an issue for the pioneers. They are already making ridiculous money testing business models.  
One of those is D2A or Direct to Avatar.  
Like Nike selling virtual Jordans in Fortnite, Coca-Cola shipping avatar wearables in Decentraland, or even Gucci selling a virtual bag on Roblox for more than what it costs to buy the real bag.  
Meanwhile, we slow adopters are still saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs all virtual and worthless.‚Äù ‚ÄúNothing but pixels arranged in a specific way.‚Äù  
Well, so are atoms, pal.  
Early adopters recognise the metaverse‚Äôs big selling point  
There are no manufacturing costs. No stock shortages. No shipping fees.  
It‚Äôs all virtual, boundless, limited only by people‚Äôs creativity. If you can imagine it, you can give it form in the metaverse. Not even the laws of physics will be a problem.  
I guess the good news about this is that we may finally get some form of the Back to the Future 2‚Äôs hoverboard.  
But more importantly: whatever you create there, you‚Äôll be able to sell it. And consumers will own it through the blockchain, just like cryptocurrencies or NFTs today.  
Are you ready to miss the train?  
Here‚Äôs the thing: the metaverse is all speculation yet.  
This is the time for pioneers who can afford to take the risks of pathfinding. The reason why Zuckerberg recently announced his purchase of a $3 Basic Branding Package on Fiverr to turn Facebook into a ‚Äúmetaverse-first‚Äù company.

Since they are a growth company and want to be a top 20 brand like Nike, Apple etc and want to be the Amazon of the crypto world, CDC will reinvest all their profits for the first 10 years.

The first billion dollars CDC spent on marketing this year is closer to 300 million because the 700 million dollars Staples deal is spread out over 20 years as it is with all the other deals.

The most important source of money is not their revenue stream though.

soccer,28/12/2021 10:38:22 AM,hq9hykg,"Translation: 

Anderlecht is negotiating with Rayane Bounida. The super-talent turned 15 in March and can therefore sign his first professional contract. However, the dribbler is in great demand and his financial requirements are currently far too high. Will the gap still be bridged?

Bounida, however, is a phenomenon. The Belgian-Moroccan teenager is technically superior, has 329,000 followers on Instagram and sports brand Nike believes he can become a star. Anderlecht is very keen to capture the super talent, but top European clubs like PSG and Man City are pulling at his sleeve. At Ajax he even got a tour recently.

On the day of his fifteenth birthday Bounida did not want to sign a professional contract because he wanted to focus on his education and school, but in the meantime the situation has changed. Anderlecht knotted talks, but the demands of Bounida (and his entourage) are currently too high. Purple-White has drawn up a framework that determines what youth players can earn. This is flexible to a certain extent, so that efforts can be made for exceptional talents - this happened with Doku, among others - but of course there are limits.

The water between Bounida and Anderlecht is far too deep at the moment, but all parties are still on speaking terms hoping to find a solution. If no signature is forthcoming, Bounida can leave in Brussels for a training fee.

golf,28/12/2021 09:36:30 AM,hq9dhea,"I primarily use their bladed irons over the years. (ie- MP18, MP69 nice, and MP32) 

Feel is subjective compared to other irons. I wouldn't say that's necessarily better or worse compared to other irons (ie- Nike VR Pros, Callaway Apex, Titleist MB's over the years), since people are wired differently and will inevitably have different preferences. Ultimately, only you can answer that for yourself on whether you'd like a relatively softer feeling iron vs one that's a touch firmer, clickier even.

 Another factor to take into account is how they sit at address as that can be a deterring factor IME (ie- does it suit your eye, instill or detract any confidence, etc). Over they years, they've tried out different things such as amount of offset, which is quite pronounced in the MP69's, reshaping some of the short irons, like the ones from my MP18 set, and at times even incorporate a cut in the muscleback like the 32's. Each of those things obviously will change things up a bit, but they're still blades at the end of the day and they'll be the first to let you know if you hit a crapped up shot. Past all of the marketing hoopla over the years, there's surely some differences that way, but nothing ever really game-breaking (otherwise, USGA and R&amp;A would not hesitate to try and zucc that from competitive play on the spot).

I don't know but most likely not with the amount of resources they have. But nothing lasts for ever and Amazon themselves have so many weakness's that dropshipper have the advantage in.

Proof? [https://indestructibletrimmer.com/](https://indestructibletrimmer.com/)

This store made over $2 million revenue summer 2020 within months, same product can be found on Amazon for like $10

Why people choose over Amazon? Multiple reasons but the main one is:

People are bought with emotions, how the brand makes them feel is what makes them loyal. When a brands beliefs are aligned with a customers needs that right there will form a very powerful duo. Hence why so many will spend $100+ on Nike shoes than just any random $30 shoes on Amazon. Hence why people choose Crocs over any old slippers. So on...

But my brand isn't Nike or Crocs, so why won't potential customers just buy the product off Amazon that's cheaper?

* Well the cheap customers you will want Amazon to keep those anyway, cheap customers will always be the biggest headaches so give them to the competitors. But there is so much that a smaller brand can do that Amazon cant. 
   * Personalization is the biggest key factor in it all. A brand can add so much more details and emotions to a product that Amazon just can't. Reality is Amazon is just a middle man, only reason they are so ahead of everyone is because they are mainly customer centric. Just like Apple having high quality customer service can make the biggest difference which smaller companies can't always matchup to for some reason idk, lack of knowledge or experience maybe. One big issue Amazon is trying to fix is having Chinese manufacturers directly supply them without the need of 3rd parties (hence all those people who uses FBA or ship products themselves, which is why I wouldn't recommended depending your entire business solely on Amazon. They are a platform to use but not your friends and can f\*\*\* you over anytime of the day.) 
   * There's too many junk on Amazon that with some simple pictures doesn't really persuade the customer as much as compared to if a brand was solely dedicated on making the entire experience of that product much more enjoyable from the before, during and after purchase. 

Everything the brand does from here on out comes from the audience they identify as and the positioning they take to best attract and serve that audience.

Amazon doesn't always do that hence why so many people will buy over a unknown company",1,Reddit,nike

Chinese can mass produce 100,000 pieces of same thing using machine, and sell it cheaply. What Nepalese make is mostly hand made, not mass produced, and costs a bit higher. But you want that cheap low quality machine made stuff, cuz it costs you less. This is the mindset of the whole nation.

Americans buy apple. When they give aid , they sell american products. Like military gear, camouflage, engines or ford cars.

It‚Äôs obvious: if you finish in 8th place at a big event, you get $5,000; if you finish first you get $100,000. Athletes think about this.

centrist,28/12/2021 04:39:53 AM,hq8nklx,"&gt;Just because it doesn't do anything doesn't mean it's lip service. 

No, I mean that the intention might just be lip service. Kind of like how these corporations like Disney publicly promote themselves as ""inclusive"" and pro-women and pro-""People of Color,"" but turn around and release public statements slandering their female actresses (Scarlet Johansson), or erasing their black actors from the posters of their films in China. 

It's rare in politics for anything to be motivated for sincere or altruistic reasons. 

&gt;The reality is that China is a country that doesn't answer to anyone they don't choose to. The US literally can't force China to do anything they don't want to do unless the US is willing to fight a war to enforce it. 

I'm not fan of Trump, but was he not engaging in aggressive policies towards China? It's not like it can't be done or hasn't been done. Same goes for American corporations. They don't have to capitulate to China, but they chose to because they can make more $$$ doing so.

&gt;Biden and the US very much do want to stop the abuse of Uyghurs...but the US can't pass laws for China.

The ""U.S."" doesn't really care, because if they did, there'd be a massive pushback and boycott against companies like Nike and others who use exploitive and forced labor in China. 

&gt;Despite the impression that Boomers have after the Cold War, the US can't just wave a magic wand and make the rest of the world obey them.

I never implied that, nor do I think that baby boomers have that impression either. It's more a case of putting your money where your mouth is.

That said, I still give credit for Biden at least speaking on the subject. It at least brings awareness. But yeah, the U.S. in general doesn't give a shit about labor camps or the abuse suffered by the Uyghurs.

&gt;WASHINGTON ‚Äî Nike and Coca-Cola are among the major companies and business groups lobbying Congress to weaken a bill that would ban imported goods made with forced labor in China‚Äôs Xinjiang region, according to congressional staff members and other people familiar with the matter, as well as lobbying records that show vast spending on the legislation.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/29/business/economy/nike-coca-cola-xinjiang-forced-labor-bill.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/29/business/economy/nike-coca-cola-xinjiang-forced-labor-bill.html)

We can boycott Cracker Barrel and Chick-fil-A for alleged anti-gay stances, we can boycott states that pass anti-trans bathroom laws, and we have members of congress pushing the BDS movement against Israel. But no one's really trying to go against Nike, Apple, or Coca-Cola.

unpopularopinion,28/12/2021 04:25:17 AM,hq8lu9s,"I can think of a few, main one is being money. And another is money... lol I joke but maybe alternate ways to test products aren't financially feasible/add more to the price of the product you pay. Maybe it's just businesses having the if it's not broke, don't fix it attitude (in regards to a business model that works and profits). Maybe businesses just don't care.

Best way to do it, if you can afford to or care about it enough, is combat it with your own money i.e. shop at the ones that don't even if it may be more expensive. 

Sadly, bigger brands like you mentioned are deemed 'high end' and the people that buy that stuff do it for status.. and more than likely aren't going to care about whether they test on animals. That's just the sad reality. They also have enough money/marketing/pull to just pay whatever fines and sweep it under the rug and move on.

I don't think this is a company or business issue any more than it is a societal issue. If people were not to buy their stuff, they would change (and future companies would take notice too). Ain't saying it's right or that it's ethical... but im giving you some reasons why they may not be and continue to not be. Larger penalties and government oversight might be a good way to approach it but this will undoubtedly just add more cost and make it more expensive or they'll just move their operation to a place that isn't as strict. You could impose a tax to import those items to the U.S. from those specific companies.. but it just passes the buck to the consumer. Unless the whole world gets onto the same page and agrees and implement a world standard. (which will never happen, see: Nike and Apple sweatshops around the world). You just end up forcing businesses out  of your country (seeking lesser costs but also impacting your own economy/jobs) and increasing the price you and I pay for said item. At the end of the day, many people are shopping for cheapest/value for very good reasons (living pay to pay for example). Others simply buy high end items from companies like Gucci for the status and they won't care if it costs $5k or $7k and they have enough money to buy whatever, with whatever tax or price hike. The common person perhaps can't afford to differentiate on shampoo when they are looking at every cent spent and scraping by. Governments are also probably hesitant to implement stricter oversight/penalties in the fear of losing that business operating in their country, adding to inflation for their citizens and also politics comes into play by seeing your cost of living rising/losing jobs.. you are less likely to see the government running things as 'good for you'.",1,Reddit,nike

OccultConspiracy,28/12/2021 01:48:13 AM,hq81gdq,"Angels (eudaimones) and demons (kakodaimones) were originally considered to be minor gods by the Ancient Greeks, and demons were what was kept in Pandora's box/jar/etc while the Nike shoe brand is named for a specific angel in this context. 

However, when the Romans tried ""Romanizing"" Christianity, they dispensed serafim and ghosts in favor of the rough Hellenistic version due to despising the Israelites. In short, they introduced ""pagan"" gods to Christianity because they were *that* racist. 

The Catholic Church, which came about later and was *fully* aware of the true cultural origin of angels and demons and the resulting self-contradiction, declared them to be fae/faeries, not-quite-deity magic-using creatures ultimately stemming from Roman folklore and introduced by Roman invaders throughout what is now western Europe, especially the British Isles and northern Europe. Demons were considered the mightiest fae species of the unseelie (unholy) court, also with goblins (from ancient Greek folklore) and imps (from Germanic folklore) as well as dark elves (from Nordic folklore), and angels the mightiest species of the seelie (holy) court, also with light elves (from Nordic Folklore). After some centuries, the Catholic Church dispensed with that for no good reason and only caused even more confusion as a result.

Depending on who one asks, a deity is either an immortal magical being capable of reshaping reality itself with its very presence, or an extraterrestrial con artist. On a related note, angels and demons along with all (other) fae are sometimes interpreted to be alien con artists as well. To be honest, it would make far more sense for at least ""fae"" to be lying aliens, considering certain aspects of fae lore, such as other worlds, abductions, and seriously bizarre biology and thought processes.",1,Reddit,nike

Yes, I agree. a few days ago, I learned about the implications of class war on identity politics, and i had to reevalaute a lot of my stances and views, and I think i might have been (to some extent) a part of the problem, because i did not realized how deep the class war is linked to identity politics. thats also the reason why we are able to have this debate and find common ground.

but still, sometimes, these points are important to fight for and focus on.

&gt;During the Kellogg's Strike, you could see massive upvoted posts based around identity politics on r/antiwork, that many people were calling out as being unnaturally amplified by bots as a way to weaken solidarity across the movement.

yes, totally, i've seen/read that. if you are able to get workers to rise up together, keep anything else out of the picture, because it's not important in this moment(!). 

here we are debating in the context of a man wearing gender-non-conforming clothing, which is the reason why i'm focussing on these topics. but still, keeping the grand picture in mind and linking it to class war, because they are linked and beget each other. I can not just, NOT do it, since i'm one of the groups affected by the issues brought forward by LGBT people and feminism. to put it more blatant and direct (please dont take it the wrong way): white, heterosexual, male people are, most of the time, only affected by the class war. other people like me, are affected by class war AND additional issues like (non-mainstream) gender, sexuality, and lookism. so, to me, it's also important to fight this fight, because it directly affects me.

not implying anything, but maybe you'll also need to reevaluate some of your stances, just like I did. i'm happy that I did, even if it was hard in the beginning to ""forget"" the struggle of my life and the struggles of people like me, that, in some countries (even friggin europe) are killed for being ""not normal""\* (aka the white, heterosexual, male)

&gt;\[...\]to back while selling you the newest Nike sneaker with BLM on the lip. \[...\]doesn't mean we should hitch our wagon to the ID politics truck powered by Mercedes and funded by Chase Bank. Every corporations backs identity politics, every single one. Why do you think corpos push this so hard?

I fuckin' hate these corpos for that, because if they would really mean it, they would REALLY do it. not like nike that changed their friggin IG logo to the LGBT flag - but only in countries that are ""compatible"" with it. they make money from our struggle, while making money in countries that are massive perpetrators of our suffering.

i gotta admit, im also kinda torn - on one hand, it IS visibility, and it is SOMETHING, and it forces people to see and engage with these topics (i loved the shitfest in IG, where the conservatives were ""boycotting"" it lol) - then again, fuck these opportunistic corpos for playing us and denying us in other countries.

&gt;I think if you were to ask a regular working class self-professed ""right-winger"" what their beliefs were, you would have a lot of common ground economically.

i wish you were right, but there are also some regular workers that buy into ""billioanirey deserve their wage""; and ""fuck socialism, hand-outs, and health care, im not paying for others"", and ""immigrants are the reason why my wage is shit, trump will help us all"". solidarity is, unfortunately, not as common among right voters. which is the reason why i'm so much for identity topics AND class war. 

I hate to admit it, but if I could choose between economic fairness and fairer ""classes"" VS peace and freedom for LGBT people - I would choose the first, because ~~i hate myself (/s)~~ that fight is much harder, more impactful, and I also want the bigoted redneck shooting gays and blacks to be free from class oppression by the corpos. (and hope that they'd return the favour lol)

&amp;#x200B;

overall, thank you for this debate. i came here to troll the trolls, so that they dont get the upper hand in this post. i've commentd on plenty of comments, because it's fun. (I also realize that this is not the BEST idea, but then again, dont need to cater to bad faith arguments and boot lickers hating) but i think, 95% of my energy, i've invested in our (comrade, ayee, haha ^(sorry)) comment chain here. 

in that sense, sorry for being a twat to you in the beginning.

I tell my journey because since my musical preferences veered more hyper pop I think I wouldn‚Äôt have been as receptive to red light if that was the first album someone showed me 

I think you have to ask yourself these questions:
1. Does the person I‚Äôm showing this song to prefer positive, spiritual leaning music or more dark, evil, sad music? If they like positive, I‚Äôd go more Exeter/ 333/ the fool (I really disliked good luck and only the Charli remix of drama is played from that album for me).

2. If they already like hyper pop go to eversince, gluee, or bby off the fool

Fashion and clothes is one of my hobby (discussions, watching runways and interviews, reading about the hisory of individual designers, browsing people's style, etc.). I started getting into it close to a decade ago as a form of self improvement and started browsing /r/malefashionadvice. I got into button ups, chinos, brogue shoes, nike killshots, etc- very ""traditional"" stuff. However i eventually grew out of it and my sense of beauty in regards to fashion expanded to include a lot of the avant-garde stuff. When i wear my ""non-traditional"" clothes its not bc im doing it for attention. If someone complements my outfit, great! but if not, it makes no difference to me bc *I* like the way i dress, even if its flashy and out of the norm. Anecdotally, ive yet to meet someone that dives into the avant-garde/non-traditional forms of fashion (including plenty who rock heels) doing it bc they desire attention. If anything, the people that ive seen dress for other people's attention are the more hypebeast-y types (and they tend to dress very heteronormative- just with more logos).

I think too many people, esp. on reddit, seem to think that people that dress out of the norm are only doing it to shock, offend, be quirky and unique or as you put it- screaming for attention. Two of my biggest grails are heeled boots (4"" heels and 5"" heels, granted they aren't stiletto heels if thats worth anything). No, im not buying them bc im trying to scream for attention- its just stuff i legitimately find nice and want to wear. When i see this dude, i just see a guy who likes heels and just wants to wear them bc its what he likes. thats all. Youre overcomplicating things with this ""attention"" mumbo jumbo. Respectfully, i dont know why you, or anyone else, always has to default to ""oh its bc hes doing it for attention."" People can like non-traditional stuff without just because they like them and not bc ""Look at me mommy! Look! Look! Look! I look so different and unique!.""

pics,28/12/2021 12:31:48 AM,hq7r8tc,"I never said that norms weren't dictated by culture. I just said that norms are necessary in any functional society.

I think the problem with identity politics today is that a lot of the major issues of yesterday have already been resolved. There are still reverberations of the past, but they will have to be solved generationally. There is no Civil Rights movement that people can hitch their wagons to anymore, but corporations can make it seem like that is the hip and cool thing to back while selling you the newest Nike sneaker with BLM on the lip.

I really don't think you can tell me that the people actively fighting the powers that be are those that hitched their wagons to these identity politics causes. I'll agree with you that corporations would do anything in their power to obfuscate the class struggle, but that doesn't mean we should hitch our wagon to the ID politics truck powered by Mercedes and funded by Chase Bank. Every corporations backs identity politics, every single one. Why do you think corpos push this so hard?

When you say ""the right,"" I take that to mean establishment politicians, since you're talking about policies that they enacted. I don't think people like any establishment politicians, right or left, and I think if you were to ask a regular working class self-professed ""right-winger"" what their beliefs were, you would have a lot of common ground economically. 

So if you're a corporation, you can exacerbate the fissures that exist where these social norms are by amplifying them in the media, and by introducing them into workers movements where there had been solidarity up until that point. During the Kellogg's Strike, you could see massive upvoted posts based around identity politics, that many people were calling out as being unnaturally amplified by bots as a way to weaken solidarity across the movement.

The right has made socialism = communism in the eyes of many, no disagreement there. But the left has done the same. Where those fissures that I mentioned do appear, the left is quick to jump and say that person is ""alt-right,"" or ""fascist,"" or a ""Nazi."" In fact, you did that very thing to me a bit earlier.

You need to take your headspace out of the suburban community and maybe go to a footlocker (little harder now due to pandemic) in cities. Let me tell you, Footlockers in Los Angeles are never empty. 

It's a culture, and their primary customers are not people who only buy shoes once every 3 years just because their old pair finally tore up and they buy a replacement on Amazon. Footlocker's customers are people who treat shoes as a hobby and people into sports. I'd never buy a pair of basketball shoes online, fit and comfort and cushion protection is just way too important to deal with the hassle of constant Amazon returns. Nike isn't going to dump Footlocker, maybe ever. Why would they remove their #1 physical channel (who they have specifically called out as a strategic partner numerous times)?

It's one of those things where a singular god takes on a lot of different portfolios (for a variety of reasons) and it's difficult to find a characterization that encapsulates all of those aspects while making them unique from the other gods in the pantheon.

facepalm,27/12/2021 10:05:53 PM,hq771ds,"It seems that you know less about this stuff than I do. Let me share some knowledge (I'll add source at the bottom):

Nike has been producing shoes in China since the 80s. They bounced back from covid faster than any other country, increasing their discretionary income making them a key market for the Nike brand. In the last quarter, sales of Nike surged in China 51% (2.3B). China is Nike's fastest growing market.

The current issue at hand:

80% of the country's cotton is produced in Xinjiang, and there are allegations of forced labor that political leadership is denying. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying on Thursday called the reports ‚Äúmalicious lies fabricated by anti-China forces.‚Äù Nike (and other international companies) are taking a global economic hit from these allegations, but their ties with China run deep. 

Now, to counter your argument- it's very likely that Nike shoes are the most affordable, reliable, and comfortable shoes available in the region. It doesn't make them hypocrites for wearing them while picketing (probably for hours) against human rights issues in the area.

soccer,27/12/2021 10:03:52 PM,hq76qrw,"Hard to say, they were changing frequently in the last few months.

Frenkie earns probably the most, but Nike pays a huge chunk. IIRC we pay him slightly below 200k/w.

Busquets was up there as well, but reduced his wages, so I'm not entirely sure how much he earns rn. Same for Pique, Alba and Dembele (after his renewal).

Not sure if we lowered Roberto's wages already, but if we don't renew him on significantly lower wages.

Ag√ºero and Pjanic were earning quite a bit as well, but aren't on our wage bill anymore.

Next up, there are Memphis and ter Stegen, who are on fair wages and deserve as much, even if they're in a bad form/injured.

The only problematic wages are on Umtiti and Coutinho. They're not needed while earning a lot. Coutinho seems to get loaned out, so that should free up enough to get another signing in, but we're still stuck with Umtiti.

We're back on a healthy wage/revenue ratio and once we've got rid of Umtiti and Coutinho we should be able to afford pretty much anyone. Thankfully our new board understands the importance of a balanced wage bill.",1,Reddit,nike

exjw,27/12/2021 09:36:35 PM,hq72w2m,"I was a branding and marketing manager for a company while a JW. Learning the psychological reasons something sells is a great way of recognizing why a ‚Äòstrong‚Äô brand becomes such a powerful force in the entire world is eye-opening and helps empower you to be a better consumer. It *also* helps you recognize why JWs became a world-wide and effective religion in a world quickly becoming more and more secular.

Their brand-strategy is impeccable. It has a clear, repeatable message for even the simplest of their consumers. It has many recognizable features - an already recognizable magazine, the Watchtower; the simple, blue-ish square jw.org stamp; the semi-realistic artwork featured on all of their printed and online lead generators; the dress code with just enough give to not feel controlling; and the structure - with staff, the average publisher; middle management, elders; circuit overseers, branch overseers, and Bethelites, upper management; everyone seen as representatives of the CEO itself, the Governing Body. This reminds me of Tesla and Elon Musk, whereby as a Tesla employee AND consumer, everything with the ‚ÄòT‚Äô will undoubtedly make you think of the creator. 

The internal training is also branded the same way. Their themes all float around one major, repeatable mission statement, which is found on the front of the Watchtower (one could argue their mission statement changes with the theme scripture that year, or even as simple as John 3:16). Such cohesion is what makes for a remarkably strong brand that is flexible throughout the world, even if the product (religion) is unremarkable, faulty, or repeatable. (See: McDonalds, Starbucks, and Amazon)

In addition, JWs have the ultimate brand ambassadors, as they do so for little-to-no pay but admonished to simply ‚Äúdo it for the brand‚Äù, similar to how one can be proud simply by wearing a Nike symbol on their shirt. ‚ÄúSee? I‚Äôm a part of the story!‚Äù The ambassadors are also their chief consumers, which is one of the few differences between them and most corporations. (I‚Äôd argue this is where they become a ‚Äòcapitalist theocracy‚Äô, but that‚Äôs for a different essay). Lastly, They also make sure to create an enemy out of the competition, placing themselves as thought-leaders in what they would consider a ‚Äòbroken‚Äô system.

I think this started my crisis of faith for me while I was a JW, but I shrugged it off at first as me ‚Äòover-thinking it‚Äô. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs what a good brand does - takes advantage of your evolutionary instincts by thinking you need them thereby letting go of your critical thinking. ‚ÄúOoo a Starbucks! Jesus take the wheel!‚Äù *crash*",1,Reddit,nike

90s,27/12/2021 08:16:32 PM,hq6r4xk,"Picking out what to wear everyday made me slowly sick physically and made me hate school.  Every item of clothes you put on made a statement whether you wanted it to or not.  Everything you wore made you part of a group with the same style.   I just wanted to wear sports t shirts and sweatpants everyday with some Nike shoes.  My friends slowly became the preppy group and I wore what they wore to fit in with them.  Had to wear Girbaud jeans,  Polo shirts or Calvin Klein.  Had to get a Fossil watch.  Had to get a pair of Dr. Martens.  The plain brown ones, low top.  Wearing ""no name brand"" items would never fly.  That part sucked the most.  I am so glad today that I wear what I want no matter what anyone says.  I know it is the reason I hate wearing jeans at all much less expensive ones.   My last year of school they enforced a uniform policy and we all had to wear navy collared shirts and khaki pants with no logos or emblems displayed.  Too late for us because we know who wore name brand clothes already, but man I hope those kids that wore uniforms every year didn't have to feel like I did each morning.

tarot,27/12/2021 07:48:49 PM,hq6n38y,"So the idea that criticizing the method is not the same as criticizing the person...

The Special Olympics. If everybody was constantly saying that the Special Olympics aren't *as real* as the other Olympics or that they ""don't have the same energy,"" would you still say that isn't putting down the people who compete in them? Do you think those people wouldn't feel belittled.

You mention it being people's ""chosen method"" but OP's point is that many people do not have the *option* to choose. Think of it like people saying ""Only Nike shoes are worth wearing. If you're not wearing Nike shoes, you're not wearing shoes. Whatever you put on your feet can't serve the same purpose as shoes."" And then someone else saying ""Nike literally does not make shoes in my size. I cannot wear them."" 

To express an opinion vs putting others down would instead be, ""I prefer Nike shoes. They fit my feet best."" Or ""I like watching the (winter/summer/whatever Olympics. That's what I'm into."" As opposed to saying any other way isn't *real* (or something similar).

""I prefer actual cards. I find it easier to connect to their energy. I haven't been able to get good results from digital decks. It doesn't work for me."" That's a way to express an opinion without discrediting others' experience.

It's very different from sweeping phrases like ""You can't get a good reading from a digital deck,"" or ""You can't connect with a digital deck,"" or ""Digital decks just aren't as real as actual cards."" That goes beyond your experience and opinion and into asserting that objectively that's the way it is (and implies that people who use that are *wrong* and not doing *real* tarot, which is where the gatekeeping comes in).

Does that make sense? I am actually trying to clarify OP's point and answer your (and others') questions, not attack any opposing thought.

Sweeping statements about things like reversals where people can *choose* whether or not to use them are easier to brush off (even though if it's stated as if that's the only way, it would still qualify as gatekeeping - just less important gatekeeping). Statements attacking and invalidating your only window into a practice you care about are hurtful and can have the real consequence of actually pushing people out of the practice. That's gatekeeping that really matters and I'm glad OP has brought attention to it.",1,Reddit,nike
FtMpassing,27/12/2021 07:48:41 PM,hq6n2mu,"Your body passes 100%. I wouldn't worry about the oversized thing as oversized clothes are pretty trendy for guys right now. A baggy hoodie and sweatpants is a different story but this is a pretty trendy outfit for teen guys right now and I don't think it ages you down for that reason. 

Haircut is also fine. The only thing is that you have a but of a baby face which unfortunately you cannot do much about. If you find you aren't passing very well you might try wearing ""younger"" clothes. As I said what you are wearing is pretty trendy for 16-20 year old guys right now but yiur face doesn't match it, you look more 12-14. So if you struggle passing a lot maybe try wearing what you see middle school aged boys wearing (where I live that's usually straight fit joggers, shorts, and hoodies. Lots of athletic wear). You'll pass as a lot younger as you are but better than nothing. Pre T I wore strictly graphic t shirts and nike joggers. People thought I was 14, but I passed.

I live in the Northeast so my days for running are limited until I get a Dreadmill. My current weekly mileage (if not snowing/good road conditions) is just sitting at 20kms/wk 

Im torn on just letting this go or keeping it for ""when the time comes"", but I feel I dont deserve these yet with little weekly mileage.

Nike,27/12/2021 04:40:24 PM,hq5vcqa,"In some ways this is true, but in the late 90's into the early 2000's you could return sneakers with quality issues within 2-3 years of their manufacture date (located on the inside tag of the shoe). Quality issues could be related to materials of craftsmanship under normal use. An example would be the outsole of a sneaker coming unglued or a large tear in the upper. You had to file a claim and mail them back to Nike for inspection. At that time I was going through multiple pairs of basketball sneakers a year, and I was able to return a few of them under this policy for full credit. In some cases, these were sneakers purchased at the outlet or through Eastbay at a huge discount, and you'd still get the full value of the shoe.

investing,27/12/2021 03:46:23 PM,hq5nsqt,"I think some people are going to view this as a very take but I guess I sort of see the metaverse as taking something like GTA Online and crossing it with the internet. Virtual real estate and rather than a set of half a dozen generic pieces of virtual artwork, artists everywhere will be able to upload their work and they can have their work be bought for people's virtual apartments in exchange for part of the $. Instead of generic virtual clothing stores you're going to virtual Target or virtual Nike store (already virtual nike store in Roblox.) People are already spending thousands of dollars on Roblox for virtual luxury goods. 

In GTA Online, there are status symbols that don't serve that much function but signify virtual wealth. You're going to have the same thing in the metaverse. The ""map"" will obviously be far larger and probably expand over time as more things go into the metaverse. Much like GTA Online, the amount of nickel-and-diming will probably be significant - virtual utility fees, ""fast pass"" jumps to your favorite locations (GTA makes you pay for a bedroom to be able to spawn in some of the properties you own; there's going to be a lot of that sort of thing imo.) Virtual car buying will require going to the virtual car lot. Virtual concerts in the nearby concert hall. Honestly, I think in the best case scenario from a business standpoint is much like video games - there's going to be a LOT of microtransactions.

coybig,27/12/2021 03:22:34 PM,hq5kkyb,"If there was a perfect education for how to be a goalscoring central midfielder, Jason Knight has had it.
He trained with a side coached by Frank Lampard, widely regarded as the best goalscoring midfielder of his generation; he broke through at Derby County under Phillip Cocu, the midfield anchor for Barcelona and the Netherlands; and took the next step under Wayne Rooney, England‚Äôs greatest goalscorer who wound down his career playing a little deeper. And he‚Äôs still only 20.
‚ÄúThe managers were all different midfielders, which has been perfect for me,‚Äù Knight tells The Athletic. ‚ÄúI see myself as a No 8. A box-to-box midfielder, the type that gets goals and stops goals going in the other end. Like Frank ‚Äî that‚Äôs the type of player I want to be.
‚ÄúI learned a lot technically under Philip Cocu, who was obviously a great player back in his day. And with the gaffer now, everybody knows that he was all about scoring goals and getting assists. That‚Äôs what I am constantly working to bring into my game.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm still learning, and I just want to play as many games as I can. But I feel like I‚Äôve improved in adding goals and adding assists into my game this year ‚Äî I‚Äôve become more of a threat that way, I think. Obviously, I want to keep the energy and tenacity, but the lethal edge is the big thing.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about getting into the right positions at the right time. The gaffer and the staff have been great with me on that front, trying to help me improve that. After training, we do a lot of shooting drills. The gaffer is always giving me tips.‚Äù

Knight grew up admiring Rooney as a young Manchester United fan in a football-mad household in Dublin.
He spent his childhood appearing for the ‚Äúcubs and kittens‚Äù programme at now-defunct League of Ireland club Cabinteely, better known as Cabo ‚Äì his brother Kevin now plays for Bray Wanderers, the club Cabo merged with last month ‚Äì and watching United on television.
‚ÄúIn my house, it was football, football, football ‚Äì all the time,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhether it be watching it or playing it, it was always football. My mum used to go mad! It still is, to be fair ‚Äì it‚Äôs football all day!
‚ÄúGrowing up, my favourite players were Messi, Xavi, Iniesta and that Barcelona team. Obviously, the Manchester United team that won the Champions League. (Paul) Scholesy was one of my favourite players, and obviously, the gaffer, too.‚Äù
In January 2020, when Rooney moved from DC United to Derby, Knight could not believe he would be playing alongside the all-time leading goalscorer of his boyhood club.
‚ÄúI remember seeing it in the news. We were on the way back from a game. We all just thought it was talk: I mean, Wayne Rooney was never going to come and play for Derby. But it happened.

‚ÄúFirst and foremost, you notice that he was a great player, obviously, but he was an even better person around the place. Especially for us young lads, he‚Äôs helped us all the way through.‚Äù
As a youngster, Knight considered himself a forward player ‚Äì playing primarily as a striker or winger ‚Äì and was known for his ability as a goalscorer. However, as he developed he moved further back into midfield. Playing in a county game, Knight took the midfield by the scruff of the neck and caught the eye of one of Derby‚Äôs scouts and was invited for a trial.
‚ÄúGrowing up as a Manchester United fan, I didn‚Äôt watch Derby at all, honestly, and I didn‚Äôt know much about them. Then you start doing a bit of research, and you realise that it‚Äôs a really big club. I got that impression straight away.
‚ÄúThe pitches at Moor Farm, the people and players you‚Äôd see about the place, the Nike footballs! Growing up playing football in Ireland, you really take notice of all that stuff. It was a step above.‚Äù
Since Knight, Derby have signed several players with connections across the Irish Sea. Festy Ebosele moved from Ireland when he was 16, and Louie Watson ‚Äî born in London and developed in the West Ham academy ‚Äî¬†has made five appearances for Republic of Ireland Under-21s. Darren Robinson, a 16-year-old recruited this summer from Dungannon Swifts in Northern Ireland, is another to join Derby‚Äôs youth ranks.
Knight‚Äôs move as a 16-year-old was made easier by moving into digs within walking distance of the training ground. He was accompanied by fellow youngster Kyle McAllister, a Scottish midfielder who moved to St Mirren in 2019. He and McAllister would stay up for hours playing PlayStation together.
At the academy, Knight developed under the watchful eye of Justin Walker, becoming one of the most highly touted prospects the club has produced in decades. Even among the talented group including Max Bird, Louie Sibley and Lee Buchanan that lifted the Under-18 Premier League title, Knight was arguably the star. He was fast-tracked into the first team under Lampard, being named on the bench for the first time at only 18 ‚Äî in the memorable 2019 play-off semi-final second leg against Leeds United, no less.
‚ÄúMy first time on the bench was with that crazy experience,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd then I trained with them all the way up to through the play-offs. That was a great time and learning opportunity for me.‚Äù
The following season, his first in senior football, Knight kicked on under Cocu, racking up 31 league appearances and scoring six goals. In his opinion, the best of those ‚Äì and his 11 so far ‚Äì came against Charlton in December 2019, where his first two goals for Derby sealed a 2-1 victory.
‚ÄúThe first was a bit of a kick in the face, so that wasn‚Äôt the prettiest, but the second was nice because Birdy played it into me, and I grabbed the winner. They‚Äôre my favourite two because they were my first two, I suppose.‚Äù

The 2020-21 season was especially tough for Knight.
In March, his father Paul, 55, suffered a cardiac arrest at the family‚Äôs home in Ireland. He had returned home early from work after feeling unwell and gone upstairs to sleep but then found himself struggling to breathe.
He was saved by the heroic actions of his son and Jason‚Äôs brother, Kevin, who remembered CPR training he had done over a decade earlier as a Leicester City scholar to step in before the paramedics arrived. Paul has since recovered and the family planned to spend Christmas in England with Jason.
‚ÄúMy dad didn‚Äôt have a great time towards the end of last season,‚Äù says Knight, ‚Äúand that coincided with us struggling on the field. I am not going to lie; it was difficult. But difficult times come and go, and you just have to get past it. I have come out the other side a stronger person.‚Äù
Derby experienced one of the most catastrophic seasons in their history ‚Äì finishing 21st and only securing second-tier status on the final day ‚Äî but, although it was challenging at times for Knight, there were moments of unparalleled joy. Despite being only 19 and surrounded by senior players and internationals, he was handed the responsibility of leading out the first XI Rooney selected when he became Derby‚Äôs permanent manager in January.
‚ÄúThere were a lot of senior lads out, injured and he came up to me and said I was going to be captain the day before the match (against Rotherham),‚Äù says Knight. ‚ÄúI did not expect it at all, and it was completely surreal, to be honest. We didn‚Äôt win the first one (a 1-0 home defeat), which was a shame, but then we turned it around and beat Bournemouth (1-0), which was obviously great. I would love to captain again if given a chance.‚Äù

Knight has already made more than 100 appearances in all competitions for Derby but recognises he is not yet a senior player. The 20-year-old has leaned on the advice of Richard Stearman, Phil Jagielka and Curtis Davies to try and make sense of Derby‚Äôs current plight.
‚ÄúThis season has been difficult for everyone, but there‚Äôs a siege mentality here,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe go out to play, and the fans have been right behind us everywhere. We‚Äôre all looking forward to continuing the season.
‚ÄúYou can always go up to Jags and Curtis, which is great. They‚Äôre the first to put their hands up in the dressing room and speak up. It‚Äôs great for us young lads because we‚Äôre just coming through and don‚Äôt really understand what‚Äôs going on. We have leaned on them a lot.‚Äù
Still, Knight is determined to continue to improve his performance on the pitch. He realises if he wants to emulate the pathways of his current and former managers, there is a lot to do. His first port of call: scoring more goals.",1,Reddit,nike

Warning: long comment

As a young man who wants to look his best at work and wear button-up shirts and ties every day, believe me- there is plenty of diversity if you know how to apply it. Even when you wear essentially the same thing every day. If you don't dress like this, still know that even outside of this type of style, the general ideas are definitely still there throughout, even in very casual streetwear. 

1. Different colored shirts. I tend to go either monochrome or Easter colors with my button-ups. I get TONS of compliments on my bright pink shirt everywhere I go, and it's nothing special, just a bright pink shirt.

2. Accessories like ties, tie bars/chains, watches, vests, etc can either add that extra bit of detail that makes someone say ""wow"" or can sometimes even alter the outfit completely. I may prefer standard watches, but smartwatches look damn good too. Ties are also a great way to express yourself. If I want to look my most professional- college tie. Monochrome outfit- bright red tie for contrast. Ugly Christmas sweater day- ugly Christmas tie. Quiz bowl tournament- Mona Lisa tie. Etc. Never feel color-locked, because this step can add colors and so much more.

3. Jackets. Take literally any completed outfit and add a jacket to it. This can be a blazer if you're wearing something dressier. But just a basic leather or denim jacket can add so much to nearly any outfit. I wear my leather jacket on top of both my most casual outfits and my shirt/tie outfits. Denim is a little less diverse, but a dark blue or black one is so easy. Just stay away from the light blue ""dad jacket"" color. Choosing a nice winter coat is also a good idea. Why wear something that makes you look like a marshmallow when you can wear a peacoat that looks good, slims you down, and is often warmer?

4. Shoes. Do yourself a favor and get a decent pair of goodyear welted, leather boots. Something easy and diverse like chelsea or chukka boots that stay near your ankle. Never have I felt more comfort than when I, who had been wearing Nike running shoes my whole life, put on my first good pair of leather. And once again, I get compliments frequently from friends and total strangers alike- many of which ask for the brand or where I got them from. Like accessories, just switching your shoes can make an outfit pop in a very different way.

5. Temporary, but don't forget your mask is part of your outfit. A little accent from your favorite hobby, movie, sport, etc can really add some oomph as well. Bonus points if the colors compliment the rest of the outfit!


It may sound like I'm rolling in different pieces, but I don't really have an expensive or large wardrobe. It's more knowing how to mix and match a few pieces.

SexPositive,27/12/2021 02:36:20 PM,hq5es4o,"I sympathize. I'm a highly erotic, mostly gay M who was  raised in a place and time that shamed my desires and scorned my dreamed-of pleasures. As a young person I never enjoyed one romantic, erotic or sexual interaction with another human... not a hug, not a kiss, not a dance, not even a word. The risk of exposing my true self was just too great. So I made love only with my pillow... my imaginary boyfriend.

What helped me walk past all that was to finally stand up and walk past all that. There's nothing more to it than,  as Nike says,  just do it.

At 22 I just couldn't take the repression any longer.  I started going to gay events, then out to clubs. I met **other guys like me**! We had sex, lots of sex.  It was awkward, clumsy, confusing, embarassing... and amazing! Then I met an adorable guy who liked me... my first BF! Better late than never. 

My mom noticed how happy I was. She hadn't seen me truly happy since age 5 or 6, which is when the shaming of my sexuality first took hold of my psyche. Now she saw me smiling, meeting people, dancing, laughing, fucking my brains out, learning to care for a BF... being human. She went from thoughtless shaming to a staunch LGBTQ ally virtually overnight. 

You sound like a caring, loving, sexy guy who'll be a great partner. The one thing we never get back is time.  Get out there. Do it today. Live life. Embrace every moment.",1,Reddit,nike

The best way to find more information about this, is on the stores own site. It might be different in your country, so always look up the terms yourself, before using them. 

For an example, here is a link to the website in my country: [https://www.nike.com/dk/help/a/politik-for-returnering-eu](https://www.nike.com/dk/help/a/politik-for-returnering-eu)

In denmark Nike have 60 days return policy, used or non-used. From what I know, this is the same for Nike in all countries I've seen. So if you bought them through Nike's official shop, you can try them out and still return. 

Be aware that if you didn't buy them from Nike, there will be other terms for returning products.

There's nothing wrong with sticking with one of the shoes on your original list and saving money. Like I already said, from that list I'd personally recommend the Infinity Flyknit 2.

The Nike Invincible is a great shoe. I have a pair I used for running and they're super squishy and bouncy in a way I've never felt in another shoe. But they're pricey. They're $180 USD unless you get lucky and catch a sale. If you can find them on sale for close to the price you're originally planning to spend, then you could consider getting them, but I wouldn't go way out of budget for them. Also, they are shoes that feel best moving around in but for me they're a bit too soft and squishy to just stand around in, makes me feel a bit unstable.  It might be different for you, but something to keep in mind if you spend a lot of time just standing around at work too.

The Bondi is very cushioned too and there's a reason every nurse I know seems to wear one. But they aren't cheap either and like I said before, Hoka shoes either work for your feet or they don't, not much in-between. So I wouldn't buy them blind, try them on feet first. And they're pricey too so would be more than you were probably wanting to spend.

The Pegasus 38 is actually a really good choice to add to your list as it has the same react foam as the Infinity you listed and the Epic I wear at work. But it also has a little Zoom air pocket that supposedly adds some pep to your step. They're normally $130 USD but I'm seeing some on sale for a lot less right now. If you can find them for cheap I'd go for them over the Infinity.

You could also look into finding a pair of the Epic React Flyknit 2 I wear. I see them going for pretty cheap right now too.

Basically, don't break the bank unless you actually want to drop the money for fancy shoes. They're nice but not remotely necessary. This sub will convince you you need the fanciest but just get something that feels good on your feet, don't cost too much, and come in a color that you don't mind getting body fluids on lol.

I never fitted in to that picture, I only owned two grey sweatshirts and two blue jeans. Wore those for years.

But I got more and more anxious because I felt like I was sticking out due to me being so ""underdressed"" that i chose to make a change. I had no fucking clue about fashion and my first steps was to download the Nike and Adidas app because that's the only brands I knew at this time.

But with some time, social Media and second hand shops I actually managed to create a unique style that really fits me (or it least I'd like to think that). Even though it's weird and is getting me looks i never felt more confident in public.

But what is way more interesting is that during my style change, wich took several years, i created some sort of a new social identity. Because now you just have to look at me to know I'm the weirdo.

I never thought I'd like this way of dressing, but it has enabled me not being stuck at being the shy guy that tries his best to fit in but is failing every time at it.
 
I mean, I'm a pretty huge guy (6'6) and i will always stick out because of that. But by dressing weird and eccentric I keep most of the people away that i don't care about, and people that still approach me are, for the most part, interesting people at least.",1,Reddit,nike

webdev,27/12/2021 10:13:32 AM,hq4rpqp,"You will be expected to be proficient in HTML and CSS and have, at the very least, a working knowledge of JS.


If you want to work anywhere worth the time you will need to learn a lot more and you will need a portfolio to serve as proof of your proficiency.


In-house training is usually in the form of orientation and teaching you how the specific processes of that particular business work. Almost no business out there will have the time or inclination to teach you how to code as they will be far too busy with client work and a person that has no idea how to do the work is a liability to the business.


If you want a dev job with less stress, join a company where the devs maintain and support the company's infrastructure or a small agency that only has a small portfolio of mom and pop businesses.


If you want a dev job where you will gain several year's worth of experience every 6 months, but where there will be a load of stress, join a large digital marketing agency that has a client portfolio that is jam-packed with big and international brands like Nike, Mercedes, Disney, Coca Cola etc.


You will only function as a full stack developer in very small businesses. In medium-large businesses you will either work as a frontend or backend developer but never both. Between how tight deadlines become and how specialised the work is, a natural separation of roles takes place which is why there is almost no crossover between frontend and backend.


I would have a look at businesses close to you and see what kind of frameworks and languages they work with and decide what kind of developer you want to be - focussing on more of the visual stuff and layouts (frontend) or data manipulation, storage and processing (backend).


Knowing HTML is as much of an achievement as knowing how to dress yourself or making a sandwich - it has no value and nobody cares as far as businesses go.


The fastest way to get proficient in something that has some value would probably be the JS route in the form of React/NodeJS. With the introduction of NodeJS you can design and build an entire application (back and front) with just Javascript which means you can get your portfolio going a lot faster.


I would get Colt Steele's courses on Udemy as a refresher for HTML and CSS and intro to JS and then take pretty much all of Stephen Grider's courses on React, Redux (state management), GraphQL (alternate way of making API calls) and mongodb (storage) that will give you a very rounded and broad overview of working with JS in a production environment.


Stephen Grider's courses basically make everything else look like trash as he goes quite indepth and also explains why you would do things a certain way and not another for any given scenario.


It also helps to be famiar with a CMS (Content Management System) and how they function and also eCommerce and how orders, checkout systems and payments work - eCommerce is big business everywhere nowadays so having some know-how is a plus.",1,Reddit,nike

&gt;He got close enough to pull off the major score. In addition to the weather and the city's attractions for young, rich athletes, Riley knew the lack of a state income tax in Florida could help him sell it.

&gt;Riley really put the plan into action last November. During a Cavs visit to Miami, Riley arranged a get together with Michael Jordan and James. Jordan, who was in town to do some Nike work with Wade, at the time did not own a majority of the Bobcats.

&gt;During the meeting, Riley talked to James about how more modern players should pay homage to Jordan. Riley always had led this effort, retiring Jordan's No. 23 in the rafters at AmericanAirlines Arena even though Jordan never played in Miami.

&gt;The Cavs knew about it, and while it seemed like it could be classic tampering, they decided not to make an issue of it -- mostly because the meeting technically wasn't about free agency.

&gt;That night, James and Wade staged another strong individual battle. But the Cavs won when the Heat didn't have enough down the stretch, a common problem with Miami's roster last season. After the game, and after seeing Jordan and Riley sitting together courtside, James made an emotional statement on the court that he was going to ditch jersey No. 23 out of respect to Jordan. In fact, he felt all players should stop wearing No. 23.

&gt;It was controversial and got headlines. Riley probably didn't care so much about the statement but how his conversation obviously influenced James. It likely gave Riley confidence that he could win James over by playing to his emotions when it came time for free agency. Riley became more dedicated than ever before to trying his grand plan of getting all three stars to South Florida, with poaching James being the grand prize.

If we take him at his word though, it is not ""the left"" ""canceling"" him. It is people dragging him into an association with politics that is ""canceling"" him. Again, there aren't a bunch of leftists calling for this guys head, what's happening is the corporations see his association with politics, and don't want to be brought in to it. Coke, Nike, Tampax, Mars, etc. just want to sell stuff. They are afraid of political affiliation ***potentially*** happening more than anything else because they've learned over the last few years what type of brand associations make them money, and it aint politics. They want to sell to everyone.

Actual Left Wingers don't even know who this guy is, but advertisers are very stingy already with advertising money, they don't want to get their name dragged into anything that might cause a problem, and even if the left doesnt care about this guy, the fear of them caring could be enough to drive away advertisers.",1,Reddit,nike

Rather than spending 6-10 months looking for talent then kick starting the project they'll reach out to cognizant, ""Hey I need 5 engineers to build me an app"" so companies hire Cognizant to build stuff or at the very least start the project while they hire a core team.

ValueInvesting,27/12/2021 03:23:10 AM,hq3qwtx,"A few other thoughts that I haven't seen anyone else mention yet...

How many of their transactions are cash?  What percent of their customer base is low income? I see several comments about D2C as potentially causing the decline.  This very well could be, but cash customers won't be able to shop online.  I know it sounds ridiculous that people wouldn't have a credit card/debit card/method for online payment, but you'd be surprised.  If the information isn't available online, spend some time in the stores, ask a few associates.  They can tell you if very few or a lot of customers pay in cash.  (Granted this associate feedback is going to vary based on the mall demographics)

In addition to that, what percent of sales is DTC for FL?  If it's only 10%, there's plenty of opportunity for that channel to grow.  If it's 80% then there's not.

Also keep in mind that this year's results could be heavily influenced by stimulus checks.  

Nike is absolutely looking to reduce the retailers providing their merchandise.  They just announced they were exiting DSW.  The fact that they specifically called out Foot Locker as a vital partner should bode well for them.  In theory the reduction in competition could help Foot Locker's sales but I doubt the DSW customer is the same as a Foot Locker customer.

https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/08/business/nike-dsw-retail-sneakers/index.html

If you're worried about Nike removing Foot Locker as a retailer, I would look closer at what % of Nike's sales are in each division of Nike. (Division meaning mass retailer, specialty retailer, etc etc).  They're obviously going to exit the least profitable divisions first.   I would say whatever Nike does, you can expect the other brands to follow suit if Nike's strategy is successful.

I'm not disagreeing with other comments made here, just adding some more questions to think about.",1,Reddit,nike

The Nike swoosh is a logo that they designed right?  Did AnalogMan design the compass?  

The comments here are about AnalogMan because the OP's pedal is a clone of the King of Tone (which in itself is a clone of a Bluesbreaker and TS put into a single enclosure).  If the OP posted about a Chinese Klon clone where they copy an original design and the pedal enclosure exactly, then it might be more of a relevant discussion.   Would you feel this passionate about the topic if we were talking about a Chinese copy of a Tokai, which is a copy of a Gibson Les Paul?

beatles,27/12/2021 03:02:44 AM,hq3of3h,"Maybe someone else has some more specific information, but there are only three actual, official Beatles products it could possibly be, if your date is correct:

1. *The Beatles Anthology* on home video (the VHS box set was released in 1996, the DVD box set was released in 2003)

2. The Beatles *1* greatest hits compilation (released in 2000)

3. *Let It Be Naked* (released in 2003)

Any other official product by the Beatles that came out around that time (such as *Yellow Submarine Songtrack* or *The Complete Ed Sullivan Shows*) doesn't have ""The Long and Winding Road"" on it. And the Beatles don't really lend their actual recordings out for other people's commercials (after a fiasco in the mid-80s when ""Revolution"" was used by Nike), though cover versions are common. Nor do Beatles' actual recordings appear on ""Various Artists"" compilations very often, such as the ones sold by Time-Life.

My guess would be that you're remembering either a commercial for *Let It Be Naked* or *1* -- I don't think the DVD release of *Anthology* was advertised enough for it to be stuck in your head. And the VHS of *Anthology* might be a tad too early.

Unfortunately, I came up empty-handed when searching for *Let It Be Naked* commercials, and the commercials for *1* [that I found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42f2qmwS0G0&amp;ab_channel=KitsuBeatles) all end with part of the song ""Something"".

Sorry I can't be of more assistance, but maybe someone else can dig up more ads from ""1"" and ""Let It Be Naked"" and see if they match your memory.

If it's not an actual Beatles product you're remembering, then there are literally [hundreds of covers](https://secondhandsongs.com/work/5368/versions#nav-entity) of the song, and the commercial may have used any one of them. If it was some mail-order album, then it could have been some compilation of songs going all the way back to the '70s, when the first covers of the song were recorded.",1,Reddit,nike

The problem is the vaccine is being pushed as the only solution and any other treatment is demonized. For instance, ivermectin. There is some evidence that it may work. If covid is so bad that unvaccinated need to lose their careers, isn't it bad enough that we need to explore any and all forms of treatment? There is a reason ivermectin was never given a fair shake as a potential treatment. The patent on ivermectin has expired, meaning any company can produce it. Because it is available as a generic, there is little profit margin for ivermectin. The vaccines however, are entirely protected as intellectual property and have a huge profit margin. Read Pfizer's financial statements, they state that vaccines are one of their most profitable product lines.

I honestly don't know how anyone can look at this situation and not at least entertain the thought that there may be some collusion and kick backs.

You can find out on the app in the upcoming section) go to the upcoming section five minutes before the specified time. If it's a draw then you will have 10-30 minutes to enter the draw depending on how nikes feeling that day and what's releasing, and then after that time has passed Nike randomly hands out wins to people. Either that or it will be released at the time and you just have to enter fast and hope for the best. Other sneaker retailers also host there own raffles though and you can enter those too!

For similar shoes, look for cushioned neutral training shoes with a 8-10mm offset (heel to toe drop).  Mizuno Wave Sky, Nike Vomero, Saucony Triumph are similar.

We need to know....WHY ISN'T JT PLAYING? I mean y'all lost Fields ffs and look what he did at OSU.

It's really simple Kirby, just tell us. We can handle the truth. 

But by telling us, he would be exposing the locker room which, if my hunch is correct, is not happy with Kirby or Stet. Or JT for that matter. It's personal, I think we all know this.

Kirby's days are numbered. Kelly is in town and he is much better coach (second only to Saban in terms of what he did with what he had to work with). Saban left MI state for a reason. He could not have done what he did up north if he stayed. 

I think that with NIL money flooding in, plus the transfer rules now wide open, the game will be changing a lot soon. The SEC is not the only conference with money. There is a lot more up north and out west. I can see where west coast teams get Phil Nike to bankroll entire teams for ads. Same with LA.  Same with up north.  Billions in endowments....old money....huge money....plus the oil money in OK and TX. Boosters are gonna be dumping their wallets.

The Infinity Flyknit uses the same kind of foam and I'd expect a similar feel. React foam is also known to be very durable and long lasting.

If you think you might want something more soft and cushioned for your feet, you might consider a New Balance Gylcerin.

AsianMasculinity,27/12/2021 12:16:46 AM,hq33qi3,"I'm late but here's my quick tips. Jackets and shoes are more important but you don't have to spend a lot to dress well. First thing people notice are your outerwear ie jackets and shoes. Shirts and jeans doesn't really matter. Your clean v-neck/crew neck and fit and comfortable jeans is essential.

Brand doesn't really matter, I'd say dress for less is better but I obviously with certain exceptions. Just don't stick to one brand. I like my t-shirts and boxers from Calvin Klein and Jockey's. Jeans and jackets, you can pretty much get it from any brand but it's good to invest in a $200-$300 leather jacket and boots.

One simple outfit is interchangeable is a jean or leather jacket with dark jeans and boots or plain low sneakers. 

Outer layer: Light washed denim or brown leather jacket

Shirt: black, white, grey crew neck

Jean: dark or dark blue(or white for summer)

Shoes: Chelsea, chukka, black leather or white low sneakers or Nike SBs or New Balance 574

Also, get a clean haircut.

That's my basic everyday wear. I'm not stylish so take it for what it's worth.",1,Reddit,nike

Austria,26/12/2021 11:15:16 PM,hq2vprj,"Ich w√ºrde dir einen Perspektivenwechsel empfehlen. Du sprichst anscheinend viel davon dass dir das Geld quasi egal ist, weil was mach ich mit ""nur"" 1000 Euro. So irgendwie. Erstens, wer den cent nicht ehrt und so weiter. Zweitens, gerade wenn dich 1000 nicht interessieren, was interessiert dich ob das schnell 2000 werden, und daf√ºr die 1000 auf's Spiel zu setzen. Und Drittens, untersch√§tz nicht den Wert davon, Geld zu *haben*. Das ist Geld wo es dich vielleicht nicht aus der Bahn hat wenn ein Schicksalsschlag kommt. Das ist Geld mit dem du in der Arbeit goschad sein kannst und dir nix gefallen l√§sst, weil du gehst halt wenn wer ein Problem hat. Das macht realen Unterschied, geht Richtung Verhandlungsposition. Viel besser als die geilen Immo-Investoren die wegen dem Kredit ausgeliefert sind. Ein √§hnlicher Aspekt w√§re auch, dass du dir die Gewinnspanne von Versicherungen teilweise einstecken kannst, weil du den Schadensfall vielleicht selber tragen kannst.

Und zu guter letzt, wenn dir das Geld zu wenig vorkommt, vielleicht √ºbersiehst du den Wert von Investitionen direkt in dich. Vielleicht kaufst dir darum Lederstiefel f√ºr 1000 Euro die ewig halten, anstatt in 5 Jahren das selbe f√ºr immer neue Nike auszugeben. Oder vielleicht kaufst dir darum einen Computer mit dem du privat schneller arbeiten/schaffen kannst. Oder eine Profi-Software f√ºr die du sonst nie Geld ausgegeben h√§ttest, und 5 Jahre sp√§ter kannst deshalb einfach einen Job als Grafiker annehmen wenn dir dein momentaner Beruf beim Hals raush√§ngt.

Ein Mini-Startup kann auch irgendwann m√∂glich sein, weil du einfach ach so unn√ºtzes Geld rumliegen hast. So, das wars dann aber langsam mit dem Brainstorm. Grad wenn dir das Geld wurscht is, legs irgendwo wertsch√ºtzend hin und passt schon. Brauchst es ja anscheinend nicht :P Kein Grund zum deppat verzocken. Ich mein nichts gegen Risikokapital wenn man weiss was man tut, aber worum's da konkret geht ist auch schnell mal missverstanden. Da gehts nicht einfach nur um YOLO is das Geld halt weg wenn ich nicht in Jackpot treff.

Material feels nice and there's decent weight though there's excess white fabric scattered in the black spaces around the skull. It's also way too short for me so I gave it to my girlfriend.

KevinSamuels,26/12/2021 10:45:21 PM,hq2rvez,"Again at this level you will live good you are in 82nd percentile of families in the USA. You won't international travel...since when do average people go as a family of 4-6 to Alps to go skiing? Most people vacation was living in Philly and driving down to North Carolina to stay at your grandmas and Cousins for a week, take a day trip to the local city, and go to an amusement park. And that wasn't that long ago...like the 1980s or 90s.

You will have a new nicer car? Do you need a $115K Cadillac Escalade that self drives? Whats wrong with a Chevy Tahoe? Whats wrong with you kid driving a Kia from age 16-24 until they graduate and buy their own car?

Do you need to live in 4b/3ba house thats 3000 sq ft with a commercial kitchen and more stone than Slate Rock and Gravel Company in your bathrooms and entryways? Literally in 1955 your average middle class home was 3b/1ba 1100 sq ft maybe 3b/2ba 1600 sq ft. And people had 3-5 kids. I didn't have my own room until I got my own apartment. I had a bunkbed. Now 4 year olds have their own room and a queen sized bed (my kids share a king size bed, I'm guilty too).

Whats wrong with eating at Red Robin, Outback, or Cheddars? Do you need to eat out at Cheesecake Factory, Ocean Prime, and Flemings Steakhouse?

Why can't people buy clothes at Marshall's, TJ Maxx, or Old Navy? Do you really need to shop at LV or heck my favorite store Brooks Brothers? I have 15 pairs fo shoes. I only wear 4 pairs regular. Do I need that many? Some of the shoes are decade old (think standard hard bottom black, brown shoes). I usually buy 2 pairs of Nike running shoes/trainers thats blue, grey, black wear them 6 months and toss them or downgrade them to grasscutting/labor shoes then toss them 6 months later.

Most people drank Budlight or stock liquor for years. Now you go to most people's home its all top shelf stuff. No one serves Barcardi Rum at their house its Appleton Estate 21.

If you could go to a sporting event or concert. You were excited to be in the arena. Now if you aren't on the floor...you might as well stay home.

We all are guilty of this environment. But people need to get real with how much this stuff costs. A buddy from college who is delivery driver he checked me this month we were eating lunch and my bill was like $80 and his was $30. I didn't feel like asking to spilt the bill and just paid it. He was kinda like ""$110 is a lot of money, and you spent that on just a random lunch."" He found it wasteful. I'll admit I forget how things are. Thays why I enjoy landlording. When my tenants flip out their heat bill is $40 higher than expected they notice. I didn't know they raised rates this year. I didn't look. But to people like my tenants $40, it matters. Thats 2 hours of work for lots people pre-tax.",1,Reddit,nike

ShuumatsuNoValkyrie,26/12/2021 09:47:34 PM,hq2kg83,"This is not a serious roster by any means. As opposed to my more heavily theme'd rosters, i figured I'd just make one full of matchups with characters I love or love reading about that haven't been featured of rosters. Some of these matchups ended up having a cool theme, but some of then are paired up by process of elimination. 

Lucifer vs Nobunaga: This matchup was my favorite matchup from the Community roster I tallied a few months back, just a fun matchup between the demon king of the sixth Heaven and an actual prince of hell. 

Nike vs Spartacus: just a fun thematic duel between the goddess of victory and the most famous gladiator.

Sekhmet vs Ip Man: One of the less-theme'd matches, this one is just a solid fight between the lion warrior goddess and the greatest of martial arts masters

Krampus vs Gotz: another fun duel, between the monstrous spirit of Christmas punishment and the vulgar knight/poet who invented the term ""lick my ass"". 

Thanatos vs Alvin York: this fight creates an interesting parallel, as Thanatos is a god of peaceful death while a soldier, especially one as great as Alvin York, has witnessed the most violent deaths around. 

Nebachadezzer vs Guy Fawkes: I was a human traitor theorist for a while, and while that may have fell through, there's now way I could have left out the peak Human Traitor candidate of King Nebachadezzer the Great, Warrior king who was believed to be God's chosen ruler of the world to punish His people for their insolence. Guy Fawkes, catholic revolutionary, makes a good fight against Nebachadezzer, as it gives him another shot to assassinate a mighty king. 

Pazuzu vs Joseph Medicine Crow: A similar matchup to Than vs Alvin, I'll admit. Pazuzu, as the scariest demon in the lands (as he was the antagonist of The Excorcist) against war chief and Historian Medicine Crow, who has witnessed terror on the battlefield far worse than any demon. 

Dionysus vs Julie: battle of the bisexual disasters, though with Orphic Dionysus being far more central than his primary Greek counterpart, this duel has the potential to get crazy. 

Chernobog vs Johnny Cash: the black god vs the Man in Black, simple as that

The Nidhogg vs Wojtec: battle of the beasts, this matchup has the mightiest dragon of the Norse against the Polish bear who fought in world War 2. 

Wilbur Whately vs Odysseus: this battle has two themes, as both a battle of wits between clever Odysseus and the knowledgeable warlock Wilbur, and a battle of the blessed, as Wilbur is an eldritch Demigod and uncle to Cthulhu and Odysseus is the grandson of Hermes and was guided by Athena

The Dagda vs Roosevelt: the friendliest of the battles and a clash of big sticks, this duel would be more of a competition of masculinity than a genuine fight with ill will. 

Apollyon vs John: the final battle for the Apocalypse, this fight is almost purely thematic. John the Apostle, Disciple of Jesus, was the writer of Revelation and thus a firsthand witness to the end of the world, with Apollyon as the angel of the abyss, being one who leads the devastation on the earth. This battle would essentially be John as the last stand to prevent the Apocalypse from consuming the world early.",1,Reddit,nike

Let me start with the BAPE Stuff. A Bathing Ape x Undefeated x ZX 5000 'Camo' is one of the first things tha comes to mind.Also the BAPE X Undefeated X adidas Superstar 80's is up there too. I am a person who wear a size 13 in shoes except for the Nike SB Lows and i have seen these prices and the avaliable sizes flip flop more than a college spring break party. Now that i am thinking about it oo might as well add the apperal too...

Some JBF Custom Joints would be SOO good. I would love to recreate the bape jordan 3's with a few changes but it's like 1200 to be made and that's if you do got all the materials. But honestly I hope to do something even better if i have the idea...   


Stuff from Supreme from 2011-13 is on that list too. For me it was the beginning times i learned about streetwear but if i do have to pick one piece from supreme it would be the APC x Supreme Jeans because that pair was the inspiration for the jeans shown in How To Make It In America. (I have a cast and crew hoodie from the show that is going to be a part of a fit so keep a look out...)

An Official Playboy Polo in White and black logo or vicer verser and it doesn't have to be supreme. I like it because it's a lowkey piece that i always thought was dope.  


Speaking of Polo, I would love to get one of the classic bear pieces as a hoodie or shirt. Nuff said.

The only point I‚Äôll entertain: The quality for the price? You‚Äôre aware LV canvas is cotton coated with PVC? And their sneakers are the same rubber soles as any old sneakers? And you‚Äôre proudly forking thousands for that. We spend about six digits at LV a year and we never fool ourselves into thinking we‚Äôre the ones getting the deal of our lives and it‚Äôs exclusive because it‚Äôs not it an outlet.

streetwearstartup,26/12/2021 09:08:44 PM,hq2fb4o,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôve wanted to share about a newly launched publication. I believe we should get behind; SEE/KNOW. 
I‚Äôve had the pleasure having my brand PILLAGE WORLDWIDE featured a couple months back. I know many can relate when I say this; that it can often be difficult making your voice herd especially when these major publications we follow seem to not lend us a platform for our independent brands. I can recall sending over a thousand emails to no avail except for a tiny throwaway article. (That I was still very psyched about) So when the people from SEE/KNOW came asking for emerging designers and brands, I was so thrilled that there was a new platform with us in mind. 

An excerpt from their website.
SEE/KNOW
a platform exclusively dedicated to the discovery of emerging independent brands and designers. SEE/KNOW is here to be an integral part of your success story.
introducing
see‚Ä¢know /sƒì/‚Ä¢/n≈ç/ verb 1. An inner-city expression of seeing something and knowing it exists
   It is the physical embodiment of the cognitive reference and term ‚ÄúIf You Know,You Know,
coined by rapper and streetwear influencer Pusha T in 2018. This refers to one‚Äôs knowledge
and understanding of street culture references as it pertains to social capital and influence. Kin
to an individual being ‚Äúin the know‚Äù of any particular subculture.

Information about the founder
DENNIS PAGE /
founder
Page is the founder and publisher of SLAM which launched in 1994. SLAM is arguably the #1 basket- ball media brand in the world. Page also founded XXL, KING, RIDES and ANTENNA, which launched in 2007. ANTENNA had its roots in Streetwear and was no doubt a critical success in the space. A long list of OG Streetwear brands were a part of that sto- ry. Brands such as The Hundreds, Nike, Vans, Levi‚Äôs, Stussy, Crooks and Castles, Ronnie Fieg for David Z, Obey ‚Äî all advertised. It was the main media part- ner of the Agenda Trade show for 3 years. While in circulation, the magazine grew an avid cult following and is now revered for changing the game well ahead of its time.

I‚Äôll say this first and this is important, it cost me no money nor did I have to pay for anything for the feature nor was paid for this post. Beyond the clothes I provided that I had set aside for things like this. It was completely free. 

My experience with these guys was awesome. Someone from their team reached out to me through Instagram, talking about how much they loved all that I was working one. That they would love to feature my brand on this new publication. They really were excited about having me throughout the whole process. 
What was super cool was seeing that they have a whole professional team of photographers and creatives over at their facility, and with that they did a whole themed photoshoot with hired models and all. A whole production that I could never afford to do at the time. So it was crazy seeing what my brand looks like with such high production. These guys are really trying to shine a light and create a space for us. They frequently have a new designers or new brands that they share on their Instagram. Don‚Äôt hesitate on giving them a follow and reach out to them.

To find such a large number of said clothing items arranged in such a fashion upon a tree of the late description can inspire ones imagination to revert to it's child-like glory. Perhaps, the shoe fairy, the same shoe fairy that mother facetiously suggested to exist when shoes magically made their ways from one room to the other, has made an appearance, relocating shoes en masse in order to lure the owners to a remote location for a religious experience of sorts. Perhaps a large, concussed bat thought they were figs of a strange native tree, and his family has starved to death since due his lack of judgement. Perhaps a lesser known chapter of the heavens day cult managed to finally graduate on to their next life as gray aliens - it is common knowledge among the industry that shoes, engaging with with loved ones and sexual freedom can directly interfere with space travel.

adhdmeme,26/12/2021 07:57:11 PM,hq275ox,"I was diagnosed with ADHD at a University where they observe you and test you behind mirrored glass. I started on 30mg of XR twice a day in highschool (33 now) and it was like I could see color for the first time. Took as prescribed. Distributed by the school nurse. Grades soared. Loved school. Loved life. Loved my passions. Loved me. Went to Art school to follow my dreams of designing shoes for Nike. Excelled at drawing. Best in class. I see pictures and read papers from then and often wonder who that person even is. Stayed in an emotionally and verbally abusive co dependent highschool relationship (because I ‚Äúwas in love!‚Äù) Ran head first into crippling depression and social anxiety. I lived in my own head. ‚ÄúWhy did I say that, no one laughed that was so embarrassing‚Äù paranoid of what other thought of me. I couldn‚Äôt muster the energy to even go and be around peers at the mess hall. I either ate subway and ordered dominos every single night. 

I Lost myself. Lost my passions. Art turned into work. Insecure and unsure who I was. Dropped out on doctors appeal after half a semester and was diagnosed with Dysthymia (told the Dr to fuck off im fine) Started my life long journey on DP therapy and meds. Got a job related to graphic design. Adderall helped me excel. I was engaged, I learned fast, and did everything to the best of my abilities. I knew what I liked. Art was fun again until
It wasn‚Äôt. Began abusing my meds for motivation from the depression. Would take an extra one here or there after work. Would stay up too late. Call in sick. Run out of pills early, waste hundreds for more on the street. Quit said job, spent the rest of my mid to late 20s in the dark in my parents basement. Hating myself and scared to do anything about it. Using my Adderall to play video games. (CoD WAW specifically - I was ranked #2 in kills on the leaderboard in TDM) I was admitted to an intensive Outpatient program for my depression. They took me off my ADHD meds and I was livid. I couldn‚Äôt even drive to the hospital in the mornings without falling asleep at the wheel. But I learned a lot in that program. CBT therapy was especially helpful. Came out to home and continued the Adderall abuse on and off In order to enjoy things in life. Always saying it would be different every few months. That I would take it as prescribed or to not take it at all. And I would. Lied to a-lot of doctors to get more. Told on myself to a few because I knew I couldn‚Äôt continue. Always restarting the same cycle. Rinse and Repeat in some form or fashion for the next 10 years. 

Last June I fell out of an attic landed on a bedpost and shattered my scapula as well as tearing a bunch of ligaments in my shoulder (HVAC Tech).  Abused the painkillers and drank on them. Still abusing the Adderall, drinking with a cocktail of sleep meds to come Down. About a year ago I had moved states to live with my brother, thinking a change of scenery would help. Received a severance package and continued to do the same thing here on and off. Tried different therapies for my depression (TMS, Esketamine, 2nd round of ECT) all while drinking and abusing amphetamines. 

June 20th I checked myself into detox. I‚Äôve been in recovery since and am currently in a sober living house. I still have all the same symptoms without the Adderall and Alcohol to treat them. Alcohol im okay on giving up. Its terrible for your body and your mind. 

But I struggle with being present, every second of every day. And I hate it. Its like everything in the world is 2D. I‚Äôm talking without knowing what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm existing not living. Im a ghost of myself. The disassociation is as bad as ever. 

It‚Äôs like reading a page in a book and realizing you didn‚Äôt absorb ANY of it - except your entire daily waking life. I have always had terrible Anhedonia (hence the eventual Adderall abuse in order to sit down and enjoy things) so the lack of passions and interests while Unmedicated is something I‚Äôve come to accept. But it‚Äôs a bleak future. Even when I was feeling myself in the past, even on those days I didn‚Äôt take it, I was always on A stimulant. I can‚Äôt help but think again that ‚Äúmaybe it will be different this time‚Äù but I know it won‚Äôt. Unless someone else has that bottle and is distributing them to me I cannot be on stimulants. Not for the foreseeable future. I just don‚Äôt know what to do otherwise at this point. Because a relapse isn‚Äôt what comes next. What comes next is I kill myself. I have to learn to live in this brain and accept that this is just what life is for me. And that‚Äôs terrifying. Because Life in greyscale doesn‚Äôt seem like life at all. 

I don‚Äôt even know where I was going with this. I did start Strattera and I think its working since I randomly came across this post and typed this shit out. I am very ADHD and I never ever forgot to take my meds. I rarely had any extra.",1,Reddit,nike

churning,26/12/2021 07:48:02 PM,hq25vyu,"Short, delayed trip report to Portland, OR, from Thanksgiving. Stayed 4 days, 3 nights.

Main highlight was burning the Amex Plat $200 FHR credit at the Duniway. I had been scouting FHR hotels ever since the credit was announced and was surprised to see a $179 rate (almost exactly $200 after taxes) during Thanksgiving weekend. We stayed here for one night, received an upgrade to a corner room with a view (not bad), free breakfast, late checkout, and $100 property credit. Location was excellent downtown, and traffic was not bad at all either. The hotel had just opened an apparently highly rated new restaurant in the lobby that the $100 credit was eligible for. Unfortunately it was fully booked already on the night of our stay. It was OK, we were told, because we could get free breakfast there the next morning. So the next morning we arrive 30 minutes before the end of breakfast and there was a line of 20 people, and they had closed their waiting list minutes before we arrived. Lack of staffing, it looks like. We went across the street to get free breakfast at the Hilton, which was mediocre but at least it wasn't crowded.

I was pretty disappointed that we couldn't use the FHR benefits aside from getting parking credited from the $100. The room upgrade was likely the same we would have received as Hilton Gold anyway. It cost nothing out of pocket so I guess I can't complain.

Other two nights spent at the Hyatt Place Beaverton. I used a GoH booking at 8k/night, but front desk said they weren't upgrading Globalists at their property as of March. If you're in Beaverton, Oyatsupan is an amazing Japanese bakery next to the Nike campus.

Overall, nice to get a vacation basically entirely on benefits and points. Total 16k WoH transferred from UR, and that was it.",1,Reddit,nike

Now that my wife and I bought and moved into our first home, I'm gonna have more room for display and for storage, but I'll likely offload a few pairs. I have a few listed on StockX and GOAT while I await my A Ma Maniere 1s to arrive this week. 

I'm thinking of keeping my collection below 50 at the absolute max, but hopefully closer to 30 so I can rotate and wear them all. 

I probably only have 5 pairs that are still DS. I try to wear everything I buy, but there have been a few I'm waiting to open. 

My collection is all Nike/JB, the only shoe announced for 2022 that I can think of off the top that I'm interested in is the ""Brotherhood"" AJ1s in the light purple and yellow. 

My wife would appreciate it if I sold a pair or two for each one I buy. She never tells me my collection is an issue which I appreciate, but I'm also at the point after a few years of being really into kicks that I want to value what I have and it's less about what the new hype is.

The Ultraboost is a max cushion shoe from Adidas, so you‚Äôll want to look at other max cushioned shoes. Some options: Nike ZoomX Invincible, Hoka One One Bondi 7 (can‚Äôt recall at the moment if they‚Äôve released the 8?), Asics Novablast 2, Brooks Glycerin (whichever their latest model is; might be a little firmer than the Ultraboost). 

Most runners will have a variety of shoes because shoes with different fits, stack heights, firmness, etc. will also strengthen your feet and make them stronger.

Black owned can simply be the difference in knowing what‚Äôs inside the place. If I am looking to go to a beauty supply store, sometimes I have negative experiences when the shop owners are non Black, so maybe seeing Black owned would help me feel more comfortable going in.

I'm not a big proponent of fancy gear (clothing). I run in a pair of cheapy joggers from Old Navy; Hanes bra, socks, and Ts; and now that it's winter, a Nike pullover hoodie I got at REI's discount rack. I also got an inexpensive reflective harness for night running for safety reasons. 

But don't skimp out on shoes. Your feet support your whole body and the impact of running affects your ***whole body***. 

Anecdote: I had to take a break from running when I took a physically demanding job that had me on my feet, putting in miles every day. When my shoes started dying (read: the foam was breaking down, not as supportive), I began to get terrible backaches every day. Within a couple of days after getting new shoes, the pain was gone. *That is what shoes can do for you.* 

While I was determining whether running was the hobby for me, I ran in a pair of inexpensive walkers from Sketchers that I already had. After a few months, I realized that I needed some real running shoes that would do the job. I also got fitted at Fleet Feet and spent about $120 on a pair of Asics 2000s. I ran in the shoes that very day and loved them. That turned out to be the perfect shoe for me and I've bought several pairs.

Yes, I fully agree to keep an eye out for the previous year's model once you have a brand and model that works well for you. In my case, I also keep an eye on the Asics website for sales, since I know what I want from them. The same model was &lt; $100 the next year.

Never tried them but they do look stylish. But the stack height looks pretty thin for my tastes... they look 25mm or less in the heel.  That's just too bare bones for me these days... maybe as a new college grad those would've worked given fresh knees &amp; springy joints, but not now.  Those remind me of the Nike Free 3.0 ""minimalist"" running/""barefoot running"" shoe era.  I still have a bunch of minimalist running shoes. I just use them for walking now.

The only shoes currently on my short list is the Puma Velocity Nitro &amp; Endorphin Speed 2 for up-tempo/strides days, and maaaaybe an ultra max-cushion shoe like the FreshFoam More V3 for recovery days.  I'm a decidedly middle-of-the-pack runner these days.  So the thought of buying dedicated racing flats to run 400m repeats, or a full carbon super-shoe to limp across the finish after going the full distance, seems pretty pointless... Even if I shaved 5mins off my sub-4 marathon, that's still not a crowning achievement. Certainly not worth spending $275+ for a full plated racer.

Bar√ßa wasnt bankrupt at the time like they are now and Ronaldinho was a valuable player back in 2002/03  but he wasnt at the level of stardom that Haaland is right now. 

Not to mention that the main architect of that signing wasnt Laporta, but Sandro Rosell, who worked at Nike Brazil for a while and already knew Ronaldinho. They had an advantadge in the race to sign him, they wont have that with Haaland.

Ronaldinho was already playing UEFA with PSG who at the time was just an upper mid table team in Ligue 1. So he was ok not playing in the UCL for a year, because he had never played the competition before. Again, not the same case with Haaland who has already played in the UCL for a couple of seasons already at 21.

Also I want to remember you that Laporta, who was an underdog in the Bar√ßa elections of 2003 faked he had an agreement with David Beckham to swing the socios opinions. Once Beckham signed for RM it didnt matter because he had already won the elections, then went for Ronaldinho, thanks to Sandro Rosell.

nrl,26/12/2021 08:03:45 AM,hq07w4w,"Ash Barty believes the Broncos have made a smart move by hiring the mindset coach who helped her become the world‚Äòs top women‚Äôs tennis player.

The Broncos have recruited Ben Crowe, the former Nike executive who has worked with Tiger Woods, Dylan Alcott, Steph Gilmore, the Richmond football club, Barty and many corporate heavyweights, on a consultancy basis as a player mentor for the new season.

Crowe comes with the highest recommendation from Barty who has consistently praised him for being instrumental in her rise from temporarily giving the sport away to being a two-time Grand Slam winner.

‚ÄúCrowey is incredible,‚Äù Barty told News Corp at the filming of a new Uber Eats commercial to screen throughout the Australian Open.

‚ÄúHe is a master of his trade and I put so much trust in him. I think he will do great things with whatever team or sport he is surrounded by.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt watch a lot of NRL (Barty is a devout Richmond AFL fan) but I am sure he has a lot to offer.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt say all his secrets, but one of his biggest assets is that he is able to communicate with you in a way that helps you see clarity to be the best version of yourself in a very simple way. It is not an easy thing to do.

‚ÄúBecoming the best version of yourself every single day. That is kind of what I do with him and everyone does.‚Äô‚Äô

Barty has been world No 1 for two years and Crowe has been praised as a key factor in Barty handling the relentless pressures of being the game‚Äòs top player.

Barty‚Äòs unassuming ways were evident on the set of the Uber commercial, where she quietly and comfortably mixed with production staff and extras brought in to act as fans in the stands, as she posed for the commercial to promote Uber‚Äôs new grocery and convenience categories.

The advertisement will have three different online endings where fans will be allowed to choose how to solve a stadium blackout.

Part of Crowe‚Äôs creed is to encourage players not to align their self worth to their success as a player or become too obsessed about public recognition, instead being grateful for what the sport has given them and be prepared to be vulnerable, which could be a valuable asset for a Broncos team with fragile self-esteem.

‚ÄúWe are so hard on ourselves as a human race,‚Äô‚Äô Crowe once said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got this unconscious, negative bias. We get caught up with perfection myth or feeling like we‚Äôre not good enough or don‚Äôt deserve to be captain or loved enough, successful enough.

‚ÄúYou can give yourself permission to be imperfect but also unconditionally worthy.‚Äô‚Äô

One key area where Crowe could make an impression at the Broncos is in the leadership ranks which have been worrying thin.

Experienced recruit Adam Reynolds is likely to be club captain, which will be a temporary solution, but the options behind him are limited.

Crowe worked wonders with Richmond captain Trent Cotchin, who went from being tagged one of the worst leaders in the AFL to a three-time premiership captain and lauded as one of his team‚Äôs most selfless players.",1,Reddit,nike

technology,26/12/2021 06:54:54 AM,hq02zkv,"People usually started taking out their ""lols"" and ""lmaos"" when they know they're completely wrong. Maybe it's a coping mechanism, or maybe it's a well known psychological knee-jerk reaction. I'm not sure.

There is no question whatsoever that when a private company prevents you from using a market good in whichever ways you want (whether it be resell it, or use it for your own purposes), that's an extension of corporate power into our own lives that is not acceptable. Now sure, there can be (and there ARE) exceptions to that logic that I would accept due to extraneous circumstances - but the overall point stands.

The only reason why you say it's ""okay"" for us to not *own* one (virtual goods) but not the other (physical goods), is because in one of those cases, they can get away with it much more easily, since they create all the rules pertaining to that good. In the virtual realm? They're Gods. They can do whatever they want. In the physical realm? Not so much. I want to see Nike charging me a subscription fee for the T-shirt or shoes I bought. Go ahead. And when I refuse to pay, I want to see Nike employees coming to my house, and trying to find said T-shirt and shoes underneath my mattress, in my closet, in my fridge, etc. Go ahead.

But THAT type of intrusiveness is MUCH MORE EASY to do when you create the whole digital realm and landscape. There is no ""hiding under the mattress"" or ""hiding in the fridge"". You either pay the subscriptions, or they lock you off entirely. No questions asked.

This level of insanity wouldn't be permitted in any other circumstance. It's only ""okay"" because we're talking about 1s and 0s on a server somewhere. But to me, that makes no difference to the fundamental logic whatsoever. It's about whether you want to empower the consumer and regular folks, or allow corporations to run amuk. If you rather it be the second option, because ""*it's just a venue bro, lol*"", then be my guest. Try to make a Gladiator's Death-Combat Ring or set up a Squid Game with 500 participants, and we'll see what *the Government* thinks of your venue.

&gt;But‚Ä¶ your post completely underestimated hundreds of years of contract law that existed before computers lol. If it‚Äôs in the contract‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll you get what you paid for. 

You're in no position to tell me ANYTHING about history. Contract law is very simple: your contracts and your ToS's can only contain clauses which the government allows - or in other words, has not forbidden.

Which is why if you sign a contract that says ""*thou shall become my slave*"" or ""*thou shall give me his life*"", those contracts are null and void. It's entirely possible that the subject of the contract would nonetheless sign it, because they would not be aware of the illegality of such clauses, but anyway...

Corporations do this all the time, like in employment contracts, if they know that the subject of the contract is unlikely to either 1) detect the illegality), 2) have the monetary means to challenge the contract on the courts, or 3) have the time and dedication to carry on a judicial case against the corporation.

So you're right: Corporations can demand whatever forms of payment they want, if Government does not intervene and stop this madness. But if you give this market logic 2 or 3 more decades, everyone will regret it, because we're going to reach the final act, the final stage, the final conclusion of this Capitalistic Madness - which is that Corporations will rule you and your life, you will own nothing, and every appliance inside and outside your house will be riddled with ads, spyware and monthly subscriptions. We'll see how *YOU* will like it then.

This exact thread should have been a cautionary tale, but I see you're not taking the warning seriously enough.

&gt;You just live in a fairyland where you think you bought something you didn‚Äôt. Jokes on you.

I'm not living in a fairyland. I know I don't own any virtual goods. That wasn't my argument.

goodyearwelt,26/12/2021 04:08:26 AM,hpzo0fv,"Ok ok, I think I get it. 

So, one point... the difference between a Viberg and a pair of Clarks desert boots is very prominent. They're essentially different products. The only thing they share in common is where they go on your body. Vibergs are full of support, and weigh probably 2-3x as much. 

When you're talking about comfort, what you're really talking about is fit and support. I see above that people have thrown out a few suggestions of some broadly fitting models (Alden Indy, for example), but the reality is that the Indy *might* fit you really well, or it *might not*. The only way to know is to try it on. 

Another company in the ""broadly fitting"" category that is a bit closer to your budget is Grant Stone. They [make](https://www.grantstoneshoes.com/collections/boots/products/diesel-boot-storm-suede) a couple of [options](https://www.grantstoneshoes.com/collections/boots/products/brass-boot-black-chromexcel-wedge-sole) *kinda* similar to the Vibergs you liked. Grant Stone has a decent selection of sizes and widths, they offer free exchanges, and their online chat is good to help with sizing, so I'd probably recommend starting there. 

All of that said, if any of this has to do with some kind of r/buyitforlife ""I'm going to buy some good quality boots in order to save money. Buy once, cry once!"", sort of thing, then forget it. A $300 Grant Stone will never be cheaper over the long run than some [Nike Revolutions](https://www.nike.com/t/revolution-5-mens-road-running-shoes-extra-wide-ZXqS6C/BQ3204-001) with a [Superfeet insole](https://www.rei.com/product/724381/superfeet-blue-all-purpose-comfort-insoles) thrown in when the old ones wear out.",1,Reddit,nike

The import ban will come into effect within 180 days  
by Dave DeCamp Posted onDecember 23, 2021CategoriesNewsTagsChina  
President Biden signed a bill into law on Thursday that bans all imports from China‚Äôs Xinjiang region over allegations of forced labor as the US continues to ramp up the pressure on Beijing.  
  
The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act creates a presumption that all goods sourced from Xinjiang are the products of forced labor. US companies that wish to continue to do business in the region can apply for exemptions but must present ‚Äúclear and convincing evidence‚Äù that their supply chain is free of forced labor.  
  
The import ban must be implemented within 180 days of President Biden signing the bill. The legislation could also be used to target Chinese officials with sanctions who the US deems responsible for alleged human rights violations.  
  
The import ban will have a significant impact on Xinjiang‚Äôs economy and the US companies who do business in the region. Many US corporations source goods from Xinjiang and some lobbied against the legislation, including Nike and Coca-Cola.  
  
Coca-Cola told The New York Times that it ‚Äústrictly prohibits any type of forced labor in our supply chain‚Äù and uses third-party auditors to monitor its suppliers in Xinjiang. But the corporate pressure did not sway Congress, and the bill passed unanimously through the Senate and near-unanimously through the House in a rare show of bipartisanship.  
  
Most of the claims of forced labor in Xinjiang come from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank whose funders include the Pentagon, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin.

Perfectfit,26/12/2021 03:26:47 AM,hpzjj6s,"Exactly. I have this one inch scar on the side of my right index finger from a slicer in a restaurant. The first few weeks, if you need extra sliced tomatoes to top the burgers, you clean the slicer, put on the somehow-always-wet chainmail glove, chop off the top of the tomato to even it out, slice away, clean everything and go back to your now 7 minute late burger. After a year, you rush back, spray bleach, wipe, slice the tomatoes til they're even, spray and wipe again and get back to the line in about 90 seconds.

I knew better. I know better. I have a one inch scar nonetheless. Also a Nike ""swoosh"" scar from a 450¬∞ F cookie sheet corner because I didn't glove up before grabbing the biscuits. Yea, we ""know"". We just don't actually follow through hehe.",1,Reddit,nike

explainlikeimfive,26/12/2021 03:07:24 AM,hpzhfgy,"""Selling your data"" was the criteria you used to justify your conclusions.  It is not ""hair-splitting"" to point out that Google does not meet that criteria.  No one disputes that Apple and Google are different companies with different business models.  The question is whether these differences have different ethical weight.  The differentiator that you have repeatedly mentioned is that Google uses a deep database and algorithm to create targeted ad space that other companies can access, while Apple only does that to create ad space for itself.  But you have not addressed why that matters.

Let's go back to an example that you've been ignoring.  Google serves up an ad for Nike to a person that has shown an interest in buying shoes.  Apple serves up an ad for a microfiber cloth for a person who has shown an interest in buying  screen cleaners.  

Why is one better than the other?  Would Google's actions be more justified if they bought Nike, and were thus making even more profit from that ad?  Look at if from the consumer's point of view.  Are you better off seeing a variety of items that match your interest, or just those being sold by the company who has your data?  Would you be better off only seeing shoes being sold by Google?  Would you be better off seeing a bunch of microfiber options?

Walmart will hit people with ads for products they sell based on demographic information of their customers.  CBS will sell ad space to other companies based on demographic information of their viewers.  Apple and Google do this at a far targeted and data-intensive way.  

If Google's business model with regards to personal data use is more problematic than Apple's, then surely the companies who pay Google to access targeted customers are also problematic.  Company's like Apple.  Yes, Apple pays Google to deliver targeted ads.  And Google pays Apple to use Google as a default search engine.  And both use your personal data to generate income for themselves.",1,Reddit,nike

Are you an overthinker? Then, don't. Just act. Idk how old you are, but that plays into it a bit as well (life and relationship experience). 

Now, context here: imagine how you would talk to and treat and lead and teach and discipline a child, or even a pet. Now, do that with her. Subs don't care what you do, they just want you to do SOMETHING. Don't get caught up in ""will she like it?"" ""Is this what she wants?"" ""Did I do that right?"" Who Cares!? Just do it (Nike).

This allows them to secure a target market while keeping the core product and colors at full price and never discounting them.

* Gen. Chuck Yeager (yes that Chuck Yeager) talked about the nuclear mission in a picture book on the USAF (sadly I lost it).  During the 60's, 70's and early 80's the plan was to strap nukes on any tactical aircraft that could fly. This resulted in fighters and interceptors having nukes when on alert. How would they make it back?  They'd have to find a lake or neutral country as most permanent bases would be clicking hot for decades....
* Air Defense units that used the Nike/Nike Hercules system had nuclear warheads to shoot down them commie bomber formation or try and blow up the hordes of Soviet tanks.
* Even the US Army had tactical nukes during the 50's and 60's, not to mention Pershing Missiles in the later part of the Cold War.

They lasted less than 6 months, and their CS told me that the shrinking I experienced and made them extremely painful was *normal*. Not cool for $150 shoes. I've had better luck with the Sketchers version of knit shoes and I wash those too. I also have good luck with Frye, both boots and flats. 

My other favorites are Aetrex and I just got a pair of Earth sandals that don't look so orthodic. For athletic shoes I get Nike with laces so I can widen them up over the top of my foot. Wearing shoes that go over the top of my foot is almost a no go at this point otherwise.",1,Reddit,nike
metaverse,26/12/2021 12:31:42 AM,hpz06ya,"That is part of the key question. Let's call that the A to B question. That is,   First of all the use cases are a good starting point. If hou expertise is in games, the you should be asking what opportunities does the Metaverse offer, preferrable something that has been overlooked or for which you already have some IP for that works well. That is: Where am I now in terms of products and services, and Where do I want to get to? Sort of: How do I get from A to B. And you need to anticipat where others will be playing in this space. This is, in essence, the most simple view of the migration path. And a good migration pagh should allow changes to adapt to market changes. 

Beyond that we need to recognize that any product offering needs to be appropriate to the resources you that you can muster. Your approach should avoid patent and copyright pitfalls or you sill be spending a lot of time and money in court. IANAL, but clearly the use of contracts of adhestion have had problems that you may want to avoid. Companies with ""attractive"" products such as athletic collectables are moving toward botique or atelier product offerings. This is work environment that is production plus art srudio. Think about Andy Warhol's approach, maybe tied to blockchain or NFT. What I'm heading toward here is the case of brigading for arbitrage items. Nike suggests thag the virtual storefront may offer you a purchase price and a discount lprice. The discount price may require you to ""stroll"" through the store looking for clues or tokens. Once you have found the ones needed, you are eligible to the discount purchase price. Now, unbeknowst to Nike, 8 of your closest friends are watching over your shoulder. And now they are ready to sweep in to purchase the remaint stock of Larry Bird suspenders. Nike has to be aware of tge. How will they deal with this issue, or, is that to their advantage to have a supply chain of ezger collectors to support their marketing efforts. I believe it was Adidas that sold out their stick in record time, $22M in an afternoon using NFT's. (See The Verge) Now is that an arena you can play in, or one to be avoided? Clearly, the Metaverse is going to be complicated and challenging. I suggest you start collecting Use-Cases, they will form the backbone of the Metaverse.",1,Reddit,nike

With Google ads, I can specifically target people who have an interest in investing, have a mortgage, are between 25 and 30, etc. With external cookie matching I can target likely voters on top of that, with rooftop-level accuracy for home address.

I can run ads to a site I control and cookie-match those users to other data services to build that ad profile elsewhere.

If you're just getting Google ads for Nike and not retargeted ads or ads for your specific demographic profile, you're in the minority.

Meaning Chris Paul initiates contact and it's a foul 100%. I thought they were not gonna call that mess anymore? 

I think this stems back to when Steph came out of nowhere and demolished NBA's favorite players. Also probably the fact that he is signed by Under Armour not NBA's preferred brand NIKE.

LeftWingMaleAdvocates,25/12/2021 11:11:53 PM,hpyqqhz,"This does start to sound like a religious argument when you blame everything bad on capitalism and deny its role in anything good. I don't think we're going to see eye to eye on this when you keep such a twisted and biased view of what capitalism is.

Let me pick just one point:

&gt; We've given less effort to creating those system than Nike spent on deciding on last season's shoe colours. It seems disingenuous to say ""I guess nothing exists"" just because we haven't tried.

That's just intellectually dishonest. Enormous amounts of effort have been spent, at the cost of millions of deaths, on communist experiments (or whatever you want to label those anti-capitalist efforts), as in the Soviet Union, Maoist China, Cuba, etc. It inevitably leads to authoritarianism, trampling of civil rights, suffering, and failed economies.",1,Reddit,nike
