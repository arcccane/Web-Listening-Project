Well. if you look at it in another direction, why these private companies no wanna use the cotton: is it because of the ""alleged human rights abuse""?

the problem with China is they work as a nation/an entity. The same thing happened in NBA when Houston Rockets ex-GM tweeted in support of HKers, Chinese TV station in turn cancelled all the broadcasting. The GM didn't represent NBA organization. And China even suggested NBA to fire the GM. Jesus. WTF.

Anyways, the lone wolves are also one type one lar. maybe they are jus vocal minorities for all we know.","Eh?

Suspect one of the reason ish that when he rise to become successful in the late 90s or early 2000s. there may not be much competitions especially among the canton singers at that time. Maybe not many worthy new canton singers in that era to pose serious competition or old one from 80s 90s are retiring or cutting down on their works so give him the opportunity to rise.","i listen to him sing, tbh technically not that perfect also

Hong Kongers are not oppressed by anybody. Compared to the rest of China it has a lot more freedoms.

I visited Xinjiang in the early 2000’s before the terrorism really started. It was lively and safe, without obvious police presence, although it was economically lagging behind the rest of China. There were conflicts between the Uighurs and Han Chinese aggregated by the poverty and lack of education and job prospects.

Some Uighurs were recruited to fight for ISIS. The religious radicalization of Uighurs and separatist movement of East Turkestan became a real problem. Xinjiang could’ve very well ended up becoming another ISIS, financed and trained by the US, just to destabilize China, as they’ve done before in other countries.

You think the the US is making such a big noise about Xinjiang because they care about the Uighurs? This is not about human rights at all. How come all major Muslim countries support China’s policies? Shouldn’t they care the most about other Muslims? The Uighurs are not even the largest Muslim minority in China. If China was committing “genocide” what about the other 54 minorities?

You mix a bit of truth with a bunch of lies, call it genocide, repeat it often enough, and you’ll be surprised how many people will fall for it.

China, like many other countries in the world, has to deal with de-radicalization of extremists. I don’t doubt for a moment some policies may be heavy handed. I wouldn’t even be surprised if there was some brain washing going on, after all, that’s what de-radicalization basically is about.

But killings, torture, rape, mass detention of innocent people, forced labor, forced sterilization? That’s just atrocity propaganda 1-on-1. One of the oldest tricks in the book. They are as true as Collin Powell’s little tube with white powder or Nayirah’s testimony.

From the choices you listed, I might go for Alphabounce for material. But its weight might be heavier than react.

Upper material is something to consider as well. Becoz it wrap around ur feet too. Same for heel counters. For some ppl, it might give discomfort.

Why not trying finding a discounted flyknit epic react? Try JD sports. I saw them having sale on epic react recently. If got chance to enter the nike sg employee onli factory outlet, u shld be able to find epic react on discount easily.","hello to all shoe experts here.. seeking your kind advice and opinions.

oh wow a recommendation for the Alphabounce! just did not expect that since it generally isn't considered the top of the line technology when compared to the Boost. but from the reviews i watched so on YouTube so far they say it is comparable la.

i tried Googling for the discounted flyknit epic react but don't have leh.. must have missed it because now they're retailing the epic react 2 already..

There are a few like Nike vapor max, very hype, but once u wear it and walk for 15-30mins, you will reconsider to wear it for traveling. Mine are usually reserved for wearing to shopping malls. If I go overseas, the sneaker that I'll bring is UB.

Even Adidas pureboost is much better than most of nike's offerings. The recent Nike epic react is touted as the one to rival ultraboost, I have yet to try on one so no comments.

Onitsuka tigers are low cut, not much support for the ankle when walking long distance. I usually wear them for casual relax days only.

all depends on the availability unless u willing to buy at resale price. and not all yeezys are fitted with boost technology. so if u want to experience boost, perhaps UB is alot easier to get off retail stores and at a discounted price. UB is more comfy than yeezys 350v2 though imo.

Just get Adidas. ..no warrior. ..

On my personal note, I also prefer Man Utd to sign with Adidas.

Sign with Adidas, when contract nearing end, Nike will come to snatch this pie back == more money for us.

Sign with Nike, we become Nike team, when contract end, Adidas may be less keen to offer us good deal, unless we are doing really really well!
Also, Nike will threaten to drop the deal if we starts slowly under LVG.

Sign with Warrior, a upcoming US brand, yes more revenue for the Americans, but Nike and Adidas will not offer the amount they were to offer in the case that Adidas were to win this deal.
Probably only Puma and the likes will try.

Having said all this, i'm still getting this jersey! hahaha",Just get Adidas. ..no warrior. ..,

nike was nv comfort for me, i duno abt the rest, but i admit nike got nicer design out there, they know how to play with their color combination.

i do have presto, flyknit racer, air max 270, and all 3 of this has been collecting dust after less than 5 time wear, becuz nothing can replace with UB comfort.

if i know today i am going to walk alot or climb stairs alot, i will go for UB without a doubt.

UB19 has 20% more boost than UB 4.0, and every reviewer were amaze but the level of comfort upgrade from UB 4.0, but yes, no one is fancy abt the shoe design, its ugly as fark.

but if u are planning to wear UB, then u should not expect good design anyway, UB r more comfort only.

if u r into design and lifestyle and do not want comfort, go for NMD instead, the pharell william, HU design offers wide range of cool design on it. but comfort level is MEH for NMD.

everyone has a choice,

want lifestyle cool design shoes? go for NMD

wan comfort n performance shoes? go for UB.

as easy as that.


not a fans of adidas, go for nike then,

if u ask me which nike shoes i will go for? i will go for presto for sure. its more comfort for me, but i am not sure if the rest can agree to that, each to his own.",280+ shoes for walking? i rather buy nike vapourfly 4%,

In a text message seen by Reuters, participants were told by the organiser that there would be no shirts in the racing kits that runners should pick up on Friday or Saturday. It did not give a reason.

""We are deeply sorry about this change,"" the message said, adding that participants would receive a 60 yuan (US$9.19) refund on their entrance fee, or could choose to withdraw from the race and get a 160 yuan refund. The organiser could not be reached for comment, and Adidas declined to comment.

In a Mar 24 post on its official account on social media platform WeChat, the organiser said there would be Adidas running shirts and towels provided to contestants and called the German sportswear firm a ""cooperation partner"".

That was the same day that Chinese Internet users began calling for boycotts of Western brands including Adidas, Nike and H&M over past statements saying they do not use cotton sourced from Xinjiang.

The following day, at least 10 Chinese celebrities including Hong Kong pop superstar Eason Chan announced that they were ending their working relationship with Adidas.

Some researchers and foreign lawmakers say that the Xinjiang authorities use coercive labour programmes to meet seasonal cotton picking needs, which China strongly denies.

Up to 6,000 runners were expected to join Sunday's race, which was cancelled last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",,

HardwareZone,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/threads/adidas-is-selling-reebok-for-less-than-it-originally-paid.6577611/,Adidas is selling Reebok for less than it originally paid,2021-08-13 13:50:40+00:00,fordsolo,"Adidas bought Reebok for $3.8 billion in 2006, back when Reebok was riding high and had deals with the NBA and NFL. Now, Adidas is selling the slumping brand for up to $2.5 billion.

Adidas said Thursday that it had reached a deal with Authentic Brands Group to offload Reebok. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, and Adidas will be paid the majority of the amount in cash then. Authentic Brands Group has scooped up bankrupt brands such as Brooks Brothers, Aéropostale, and Forever 21 in recent years and filed to go public last month.

Adidas announced its intention in February to begin a formal process to divest Reebok following a review of the brand that it announced late last year. Adidas said that it wanted to sell Reebok to focus its efforts on strengthening its own brand in the global sportswear market.

The German-based company bought Reebok in 2006 to expand its reach in the United States and take on Nike in its home market.

But the brand has underperformed in recent years. It failed to capitalize on the consumer trend toward athleisure wear and lost market share to Lululemon, Nike and other athletic brands. Reebok accounted for roughly 7% of Adidas' sales at the end of 2020 when the company last broke out the brand's sales, down from about 18% in 2010, according to financial statements.

""Part of the issue was a lack of clarity around what Adidas wanted Reebok to be. As a result, it was neither seen as the go-to brand for sporting professionals nor for those looking for athleisure fashion and style,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said in note to clients Thursday.

Saunders said the acquisition was ""massive"" for Authentic Brands and ""further cements its position as a major player in American retail.""

Reebok has the potential to grow sales again under Authentic Brands if it focuses less on competing with Nike and more on developing a differentiated offering with consumers and a strong distribution strategy at its own stores and through outside retailers, he said.

I got the ub19 for casual jogging or travelling long distances while I got my yzy for short trips.

Both works well for me for its intended purposes.

nmd and pure boost is abit difficult, unless u get half size up ur size.

ultraboost is very easy to slip in cuz of the surrounding smooth padding

Once I was viewing a Nike presto and the wording at the back look very faded and fake.

I always suggest getting from Adidas and Nike main stores. E price is almost always e same anyways. Though I once bought from a Nike boutique in fukuoka and they said no vat refund. Not sure why only that particular Nike boutique as I recall buying from harajuku Nike boutique and got my vat refund.

If u want to get rarer shoes go to smaller cities or less touristy area like fukuoka instead of Tokyo/Osaka.","try ameyoko ueno district, they got cheaper stuff, they are like china town. but no fake goods, everything there is real.

Anyway does anyone of you find it difficult to wear on those slip on shoes like pureboost and nmd? Like it is difficult to slide your foot in since the opening is fixed.

For Pureboost or NMD, if you get your regular size (for average asian feet), you'll probably feel they wear half a size bigger. This is because of the lack of additional insole. Just go to the nearest RSH or Daiso (get the larger sized ones) to get the soft insoles, cut them to fit, slot them in and you'll feel the comfort significantly boosted and the fit is better. NMD feels like a zero drop shoe on feet though.

The same can be said for Nike Vapormax... the default insole feels too hard and uncomfortable for me, I just replace them with cushy insoles I bought from RSH, and it feels much better.

I've also sewn a spot on each side of the Pureboosts to tie the folds together and it becomes a comfortable pair of slip-on shoes. A simple 5 minute mod for long lasting convenience.

UBs and NMDs are kinda yesterday's craze for me, I prefer the non flared heel cups of the Pureboosts, they wear better with normal jeans. And they are half the price of UBs, even for Clima versions.",Anyway does anyone of you find it difficult to wear on those slip on shoes like pureboost and nmd?

What size should i get for my item?
there is usually a size guide provided. for shoes, I have used the size guide and found it accurate. also do read the reviews if any with regards to size. Us asians tend to have wider foot than our US counterparts, so do keep that in mind

Can i change my order after placing it?
you can change your order as long as i have not placed it with eastbay. I will not entertain changes once order has been placed with eastbay on my side.

what about returns?
returns are only accepted due to defects.
you will need to pay shipping (or not) depending on eastbay back to USA for them to send a new piece and they will refund shipping fee accordingly.

I have not done returns due to wrong size but i can imagine Eastbay charging non refundable shipping fee for exchange of sizes.

I agree. My arch is not high and NMD R1s made my feet ache after walking around for a day. The UBs are much more springy and comfortable to walk around with. Compared with the Nike Vapormax, I still feel that the UB has better overall traction feel and support.

Agree that NMDs are not as comfy as UB/PB/EQT for standing/walking the whole day. One way to increase comfort is to add a sports insole if there's still wriggle room in your toebox area (makes the shoe fit half a size smaller with the insole).

Just tried the EQT 93/17's at Adidas.... the beefy boost is cushy but muted by the thick non-removable insole.... probaly need to break in the insole to get it more springy. Still, a good cheaper alternative to the UB/NMD that's still pretty comfortable. Can consider when it's on sale.","I agree.

I have a friend suffering from PF who swears by the Adidas EQT SUPPORT 93/17 for walking the whole day, supposedly it has one of the softest boost in the entire Boost lineup.

I first started to recover from PF after I ditched my minimalist shoes and switched to Nike Flex RN 2016, it helped me. You might want to try Nike Outlets for the updated Nike Flex RN 2017 if you wish to try it out, should set you back less than $100. I used it for shopping and running, and still use it for recovery runs these days.
im using a pair of 93/17 as well. So far so good. Comfort comparable to ub. Best thing is that the model got no hype behind it so can get it for cheap.

in the end, chose the adidas for its comfortness and super soft leather. It was a lot comfier than the pumas(supposedly k leather but does not seem that soft) and previously using an old nike t90, so wanted to try something different.

Initially was a little concerned as i bought a us 8.5(was using us9 on my nikes) After wearing it ard the house for a few days and sleeping with it, it really got extra extra comfy. off note, funny that for pumas, i had to use us10. I read the UA dominate pros are super comfy but nvr got a chance to try any in singapore.

I'm no pro but im amazed by the feel the boots give. Shooting wise, i think it does not give as much power(as my old t90s) but then again, my shots are always all over the place (except inbetween the posts). The comfort is just amazing. I have used a few boots in my life and this has been the most comfortable so far. Possibly cos this is my first k-leather ones. Durability, i would not know. If it can last me for 2 years, ill prob get the same one again if its still made in germany.

only flaw of the boots is the price. its still ex even on pro direct.

this is the worst grade. that's why you will get all these abrasion and of course its average and below par. less than half a season and your boots will split cos of poor glue quality they used. pay peanuts get monkeys theory.

1st grade or 2nd seldom have that problem cos they have ample cushion.

the only good thing abt f10i is that its very light and being synthetic its easy to wash.

anyway go try on the 1st or 2nd grade and you will definitely have a different view.","Tried the Adidas F10i TRX FG and it gave me a nice abrasion on my heels area...

Once discount given long queues are form.",2021-03-31 06:12:33+00:00,gravity_infinity,"A Chinese consumer boycott against international brands such as Nike and Adidas appeared to be losing steam over the weekend.

Nationalists had called for a boycott after statements expressing concern about allegations of forced labour in Xinjiang resurfaced and a number of celebrities, including the Hong Kong singer Eason Chan, publicly cut their ties with the sportswear giants.

But sports teams remained largely silent over their deals with the companies and their products remained on sale online – with demand remaining high.

China’s state media, internet users and tech companies kicked off a wave of protest targeting international fashion brands including H&M and Burberry last week after the Chinese Youth League published a statement on its official Weibo account on Wednesday attacking H&M’s previous statements over Xinjiang cotton.

Corporate statements released months ago – expressing the businesses’ concerns over Xinjiang’s forced labour risks and saying they did not source cotton from Xinjiang – were dug up and translated into Chinese, fanning calls for a nationwide boycott.

Xinjiang: China reacts with sanctions on US and Canadian politicians
Swedish retailer H&M was one of the hardest-hit brands with its name being removed from Chinese e-commerce and other retail apps while its stores in a number of cities, including Urumqi and Jinan, were closed.

The Chinese government, however did not directly attack any foreign brands.

Nike and Adidas also appeared to be trading as normal in China on Sunday. The brands could still be found on major Chinese online platforms such as Taobao and JD.com despite some web users calling for a complete boycott of all the brands involved in the Xinjiang cotton controversy.


A sale offering the latest women’s Nike shoes for 699 yuan (US$107) on Friday night at the brand’s online store in Tmall attracted 350,000 subscribers and the product sold out instantly. Tmall and Taobao’s owner Alibaba also owns the South China Morning Post.

Meanwhile, Soccer News reported that the state-backed China Football Association had “internally” condemned Nike for its stance on Xinjiang cotton but had not cut its 10-year contract with the sportswear company. Nike has also signed similar deals with a number of professional soccer clubs in China.

Also on Saturday, the state broadcaster China Central Television shifted the focus onto the US government, by accusing Washington and related non-profit organisations of manipulating the Better Cotton Initiative, a non-profit group based in Geneva, into suspending its licensing of Xinjiang cotton citing forced labour risks.

China to step up use of Mandarin in Xinjiang schools
Separately, Premier Li Keqiang visited a BASF plant in Nanjing on Friday, a German-Chinese joint venture that produces certain chemicals used by Nike and Adidas.

Pictures and short videos of Li’s visit were uploaded and widely shared on Chinese social media, although China’s official media and government website did not mention Li’s visit. According to videos and photos taken at the plant, Li was accompanied by BASF senior executives as he encouraged the joint-venture to invest more in China to qualify for more taxation benefits.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ocVn5Cn101M/sddefault.jpg#404_is_fine

I don't think the MTR goes anywhere near, so the MTR is out of the question.

Public Transportation


MTR:
Wherever you’re coming from, one of the most convenient ways to reach Citygate Outlets is by MTR. Simply take the Tung Chung line through Interchange from Hong Kong Station, Nam Cheong Station or Lai King Station to Tung Chung Station and Citygate Outlets entrance is right at the Exit C.

Bus: Citygate Outlets can be reached from the airport in just around 10 minutes by buses S1, S52P and S64.
